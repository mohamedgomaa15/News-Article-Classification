He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.\\nClimate\\nScientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?\\n\\\"Just incredible,\\\" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. \\\"You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.\\\"\\nNow, those reefs are just a memory.\\n\\\"The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,\\\" Nedimyer says. \\\"All completely dead.\\\"\\nFlorida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.\\nElkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.\\nCoral Restoration Foundation\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nCoral Restoration Foundation\\nIn 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the\\nMission Iconic Reefs\\nprogram, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.\\nSponsor Message\\nThose coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.\\nThose branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.\\nKen Nedimyer uses a tile saw to divide a coral into pieces. Much like a plant, the cuttings will grow into a new coral, creating more material for restoring reefs off the Florida Keys.\\nLauren Sommer/NPR\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nLauren Sommer/NPR\\nMarine heat wave hits\\nIn 2023, the ocean around Florida started\\nheating up far earlier than normal\\n. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.\\nBleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that\\n95% of the elkhorn coral had died\\n.\\n\\\"It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,\\\" Nedimyer says. \\\"Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.\\\"\\nAs the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.\\nRebecca Blackwell/AP\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nRebecca Blackwell/AP\\nThe extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,\\n99% of the world's coral will be lost\\n.\\nIt was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.\\nClimate\\nCoral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution\\n\\\"Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,\\\" Nedimyer says. \\\"What we were doing was not going to work.\\\"\\nNedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.\\nA tiny \\\"Flonduran\\\" coral grows at The Florida Aquarium, crossbred from corals from Florida and Honduras.

It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as \\\"\\nassisted gene flow\\n,\\\" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.\\nCorals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida.

He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the\\nlengthy international permitting process\\nmakes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas\\nhave also passed laws\\nlimiting the export of their biological materials, after a\\nhistorical legacy\\nof richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.\\nStill, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.\\n\\\"It's not all just about Florida,\\\" Baker says. \\\"I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries.\\\"\",\n          \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.\\nFREDERIC J.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.\\nActing CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.\\nPublic Health\\n5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting\\nUnlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called \\\"shared decision-making,\\\"or \\\"individual-based decision-making\\\" according to the language in\\nthe press release\\n.\\nThe move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.\\nSponsor Message\\nFinal recommendations were delayed\\nThe step came after an\\nunusual, unexplained two-week lag\\nbetween when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision\\nallows the CDC\\nto finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.\\n\\\"Informed consent is back,\\\" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. \\\"CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.\\\"\\nIndependent vaccine experts challenged that claim.\\n\\\"There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,\\\" said\\nDorit Reiss\\n, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. \\\"Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.\\\"\\nOthers agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.\\n\\\"The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,\\\" wrote Dr.\\nTina Tan\\n, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. \\\"This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.\\\"\\nSponsor Message\\nThe CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.\\n\\\"If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,\\\" Reiss added in an email. \\\"If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent \\u2014 which it doesn't \\u2014 that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.\\\"\\nThe moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.\\nIn previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.\\nBarriers to vaccination\\nBut the vaccines\\nbecame harder\\nto get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.\\nThe change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.\\nMany public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more \\\"risk-based\\\" COVID vaccination strategy.\\nBut some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.\\nSponsor Message\\nOver the past month, the change caused\\nanger, frustration and confusion\\n. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.\\nTreatments\\nThe CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo\\nThe situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.\\nEarlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,\\nvoted to recommend the shots\\nfor anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.\\nConfusion still reigns\\nThe requirement for\\nshared clinical decision-making\\ncreates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.\\nThe new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\\nThe recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)\\nBut some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.\\nSome states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.\\nSponsor Message\\nIn addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.\\nSome pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.\\nA separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended\\nO'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.\\nYoung children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them \\u2013 some 85% \\u2013 already do, according to\\nCDC data shared\\nand discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.\\nThat's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.\\nBecause of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. \\\"This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,\\\" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, \\\"This is effectively removing a choice from parents.\\\"\\nSponsor Message\\nMaking different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. \\\"There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,\\\" she says, \\\"It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.\\\"\\nThe change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.\\nA fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine\\nA few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in\\na post on X.com\\n. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as \\\"THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.\\\"\\nThe combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.\\n\\\"This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,\\\" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. \\\"It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.\\\"\\n\\\"There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,\\\" said a statement from Merck, which makes an\\nMMR vaccine\\n. \\\"Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.\\\"\\nSponsor Message\\nThe statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.\\n\\\"Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,\\\" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. \\\"By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease.\\\"\",\n          \"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.\\nOzan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\\nhide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nOzan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\\nISTANBUL \\u2014 In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.\\nThere's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium.
