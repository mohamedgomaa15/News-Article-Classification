politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.

Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.

It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Former FBI Director
James Comey
has pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding.
Comey entered his plea via his lawyer Pat Fitzgerald during his arraignment in federal court on Wednesday in Alexandria, Va. The judge on the case set a trial date of Jan. 5, 2026, and Comey is set to be released with no conditions.
""It's the honor of my life to represent Jim Comey in this matter,"" Fitzgerald said at the courthouse, where Comey's family also attended the arraignment.
The former FBI director, who has long been one of President Trump's most vocal critics, was indicted
last month
on two counts stemming from his
testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020. The Justice Department secured the indictment just days after Trump demanded a faster pace from prosecutors in their investigation against Comey.

Ex-FBI Director James Comey indicted on criminal charges stemming from 2020 testimony
The top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia, Erik Siebert, had cast doubt on the strength of the evidence against Comey.
The Trump administration then replaced Siebert with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who previously served as a personal attorney for Trump. Halligan, who secured the grand jury indictment against Comey, is bringing in prosecutors from North Carolina to assist on the case.
Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.
Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is ""sick and tired"" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the ""uniparty"" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats ""that are happy to mortgage our children's future"" — to spend more federal money.
""It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,"" Johnson continued. ""And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.""

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.
Sponsor Message
Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""
Sponsor Message
When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.

""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""From Day One, this administration started firing federal employees,"" she said, and named the Food and Drug Administration and the Veterans Administration, which she says had to rehire staff.
""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

— because it is overrun with crime.
But the conditions to legally justify troop deployments in Chicago simply don't exist, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told

against the Trump administration in which it argues that the Illinois National Guard can only be federalized if there is a foreign invasion, rebellion or if the federal government is unable to enforce federal laws.
The only ""agitation"" and ""chaos"" in and around Chicago, Raoul said, is from ""[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol firing pepper gas at civilians, journalists,"" and ""even Chicago police officers.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building
during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ
.
Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House
to make a formal request for troops
. The president also
posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge
did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops
to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.
Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with
Morning Edition
if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""
""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.

But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.

Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.

The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.

Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""
Sponsor Message
When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw
average ground delays
of 2 1/2 hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom blamed President Trump

A different aviation control facility, Southern California TRACON, ran operations remotely from San Diego during that period.
Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""

Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.
Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is ""sick and tired"" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the ""uniparty"" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats ""that are happy to mortgage our children's future"" — to spend more federal money.
""It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,"" Johnson continued. ""And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.""

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.
Sponsor Message
Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""

When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.

Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.

""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building
during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ

Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House

. The president also
posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge
did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with

if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""
""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.

a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.

It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions

However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.

Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""

When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw
average ground delays
of 2 1/2 hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom blamed President Trump
in a tweet
, writing, ""Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4:15pm to 10pm today because of YOUR government shutdown.""

A different aviation control facility, Southern California TRACON, ran operations remotely from San Diego during that period.
Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ

Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House

. The president also
posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —

if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.

""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.
Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is ""sick and tired"" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the ""uniparty"" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats ""that are happy to mortgage our children's future"" — to spend more federal money.
""It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,"" Johnson continued. ""And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.""

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.
Sponsor Message
Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""
Sponsor Message
When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.

Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.

The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes

Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a

that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.

""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ

""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with

if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""
""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Ex-FBI Director James Comey indicted on criminal charges stemming from 2020 testimony
The top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia, Erik Siebert, had cast doubt on the strength of the evidence against Comey.
The Trump administration then replaced Siebert with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who previously served as a personal attorney for Trump. Halligan, who secured the grand jury indictment against Comey, is bringing in prosecutors from North Carolina to assist on the case.
Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.
Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is ""sick and tired"" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the ""uniparty"" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats ""that are happy to mortgage our children's future"" — to spend more federal money.
""It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,"" Johnson continued. ""And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.""

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.

Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""
Sponsor Message
When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw
average ground delays
of 2 1/2 hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom blamed President Trump

Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent

""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.

The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.

In an interview with

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.
Sponsor Message
Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""

When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw
average ground delays
of 2 1/2 hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom blamed President Trump
in a tweet

A different aviation control facility, Southern California TRACON, ran operations remotely from San Diego during that period.
Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.
Business
More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building
during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ

Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House

posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge
did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with

if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""
""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.
Sponsor Message
It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and

of the Federal Reserve.

nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.

""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Former FBI Director
James Comey
has pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding.
Comey entered his plea via his lawyer Pat Fitzgerald during his arraignment in federal court on Wednesday in Alexandria, Va. The judge on the case set a trial date of Jan. 5, 2026, and Comey is set to be released with no conditions.
""It's the honor of my life to represent Jim Comey in this matter,"" Fitzgerald said at the courthouse, where Comey's family also attended the arraignment.
The former FBI director, who has long been one of President Trump's most vocal critics, was indicted
last month
on two counts stemming from his
testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020. The Justice Department secured the indictment just days after Trump demanded a faster pace from prosecutors in their investigation against Comey.

Law
Ex-FBI Director James Comey indicted on criminal charges stemming from 2020 testimony
The top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia, Erik Siebert, had cast doubt on the strength of the evidence against Comey.
The Trump administration then replaced Siebert with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who previously served as a personal attorney for Trump. Halligan, who secured the grand jury indictment against Comey, is bringing in prosecutors from North Carolina to assist on the case.
Comey's lawyers said they plan to file two batches of motions to dismiss the case, centering on accusations of a vindictive or selective prosecution, and that Halligan was unlawfully appointed.
They may also include allegations of ""outrageous conduct"" and problems with the grand jury process that indicted Comey last month.
Trump has long railed against Comey, blaming the former FBI leader for the appointment of a special prosecutor who probed contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign through most of the president's first term in office."

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is ""sick and tired"" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.
In an interview with
Morning Edition
, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the ""uniparty"" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats ""that are happy to mortgage our children's future"" — to spend more federal money.
""It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,"" Johnson continued. ""And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.""

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.

Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay.
""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you this: The Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.""
Sponsor Message
When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, ""What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.""
2025 government shutdown
The government shutdown is snarling air travel. Officials say it could get worse
Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.

The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building
during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ
.
Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House
to make a formal request for troops
. The president also
posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge
did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops
to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.
Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with
Morning Edition
if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""

Those votes, he cautioned, are at risk if Congress doesn't pass a law to preserve low premiums on Affordable Care Act marketplace plans for the roughly 4.7 million people living in his home state of Florida who are enrolled in the coverage.
""Hispanic voters helped return Donald Trump to the White House,"" said Fuentes, the CEO of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ""Republican leaders would do right by their constituents to keep coverage affordable, and they will remember that heading into the midterms.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.

politics,"A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to
a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea
ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.
Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional.
The two Democrats also say
it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.
""The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,"" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. ""It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.""
Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.
Sponsor Message
Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating
a new unease in the region
. But the Trump
administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.
The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.

It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

In an interview with

With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.
Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure
should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies
— which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.
2025 government shutdown
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says Democrats' government shutdown fight is 'righteous'
Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the ""faulty design of Obamacare"" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix ""their horrible health bill."" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.
Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed
Eliminate Shutdowns Act
— a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.
Sponsor Message
Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?
Sen. Ron Johnson:
Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.
Martin:
So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?
Johnson:
Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.
Sponsor Message
Martin:
But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.
Johnson:
Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.
Martin:
So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?
Johnson:
Well, I like
The Washington Post
headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.
Editor's note:
The Washington Post
editorial board
published an opinion piece
Oct. 5 in which it claimed ""The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.""
Martin:
President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?
Sponsor Message
Johnson:
I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about ""repeal, replace,"" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.
Martin:
But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?
Johnson:
So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.
Martin:
Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.
Interview highlights
Karoline Leavitt says White House must cut spending due to shutdown
Martin:
The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?
Johnson:
Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.

President Trump is floating the possibility that some of the roughly 600,000 furloughed federal workers could be denied back pay once the government reopens, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown.

Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.
The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.
The memo's legal argument contradicts
guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management
and the
wording of a 2019 law
signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers ""shall be paid"" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.""
Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.
Sponsor Message
The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse"" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.
2025 government shutdown
Why some federal workers aren't scared by the threat of shutdown layoffs
Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.
""The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,"" the
Sept. 30 memo reads
. ""Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.""
A
version updated on Oct. 3
removes those paragraphs.
The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.

Congress responds
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft.
""There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,"" Johnson said. ""If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.""
The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was ""lawless.""

""They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,"" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. ""This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.""

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.
Twelve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities saw staffing shortages on Monday, according to an
evening advisory
from the agency — followed by another roughly half dozen on Tuesday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy held a Monday
press conference
at one of them, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where he blamed the nationwide delays on a ""slight tick-up in sick calls"" by air traffic control workers.

Duffy said controllers are concerned about working without pay during the shutdown, with some considering taking on second jobs, like calling in sick to drive for Uber. And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.
""If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,"" Duffy said. ""I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.""

In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it ""slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations"" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to
its website
for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over
health care subsidies
, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.
2025 government shutdown
Air traffic controllers helped end the last government shutdown, and may again
Air traffic controllers
played a key role
in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.
Only an FAA-described ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major
East Coast airports into chaos
and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.
Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring,
extensive training timelines
and high dropout rates — have
remained a problem
in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.

Which airports were affected?
Staffing shortages continued on Tuesday, causing delays at airports in Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and
Houston
, according
to the FAA
,
as well as a brief
ground stop
at Nashville International Airport.
The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority
said in a statement
that it was notified by the FAA at 1:25 p.m. local time that incoming and outgoing Nashville airport flights would be reduced starting at 2:30 p.m. ""due to a shortage of air traffic controllers."" That ground delay became a ground stop — the first associated with the government shutdown — from about 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time.
This follows Monday's disruptions to airspace near cities including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.
The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA. Flights were delayed an average of 53 minutes
out of Newark
and 39 minutes
out of Denver
, though some were held up by closer to two hours.

Perhaps the biggest disruptions were felt at Hollywood Burbank Airport near Los Angeles, which saw
average ground delays
of 2 1/2 hours. It had no air traffic controllers for over five hours on Monday, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom blamed President Trump
in a tweet

A different aviation control facility, Southern California TRACON, ran operations remotely from San Diego during that period.
Burbank Airport has not responded to NPR's request for comment. It said in a
Monday night tweet
that its operations were continuing, and urged travelers to check with their airlines about potential disruptions.
What are air traffic controllers saying?
At Duffy's Newark press conference, Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), specifically steered clear of politics as he called for an end to the shutdown.
Sponsor Message
""We need to bring this shutdown to a close so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction aside and focus completely on their vital work,"" Daniels said.
NATCA, which represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers,
says many
of its members were already working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and the shutdown has put them under further strain by furloughing safety support staff and suspending support programs.
Its website has a notice warning its members that ""participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,"" saying such behavior is not only illegal but ""also undermines NATCA's credibility.""
National
Air traffic controllers say a push to modernize equipment won't fix deeper problems
In a statement to NPR, NATCA said nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, and it is normal for a few of them to call in sick on any given day.
But it also says Monday's events underscore the fragility of the country's aviation system and the ""urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.""
Since the start of the second Trump administration, Duffy has
pushed for an overhaul
of the country's air traffic control systems — parts of which still rely on floppy disks and
run Windows 95
— and prioritized
efforts to ""supercharge"" hiring
.
Duffy said Monday that the shutdown hampers those efforts, now and potentially in the future.
""It has a longer-lasting impact on our ability to make up the ground in the shortages that we have right now with air traffic controllers,"" he said. ""This is having great impact … on our system at a time when we're trying to reduce the stress.""

How else could the shutdown affect air travel?
The government shutdown could also have steep consequences for rural airports.
Duffy warned that the Essential Air Service (EAS), a federal program that subsidizes commercial service to rural airports in about 170 U.S. communities, could run out of funding as soon as Sunday.

""Every state across the country will be impacted by the inability to provide the subsidies to airlines to service these communities,"" Duffy said, adding that Alaska will be the hardest hit.
Business
More small airports are being cut off from the air travel network. This is why
The White House proposed
slashing the program's funds
by more than 50% earlier this year, despite the fact that it has longstanding, bipartisan support in Congress, as Duffy himself acknowledged on Monday.
Natasha Marquez, a spokesperson for the Regional Airline Association, told NPR in a statement that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EAS supported more than 17,000 U.S. jobs and enabled the operation of hundreds of daily flights from airports with an average distance of 200 miles from the nearest medium or large hub airport — meaning many travelers could feel the impacts.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, which holds contracts for six communities in Alaska, told NPR over email that if the government shutdown continues beyond Sunday, ""we would be relieved of our obligations as an EAS provider to those communities and the [Department of Transportation] would likely suspend reimbursements.""
It is not immediately clear when passengers would notice a change. Airlines typically seek reimbursement from the government at the start of the month for the previous month's flights, according to the
Department of Transportation."

On the seventh day of the government shutdown, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.
President Trump on social media said earlier Monday
he's willing to work
with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.
When asked on
Morning Edition
whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, ""No one from the administration."" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground.""
Sponsor Message
She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.
Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.
The current stakes are high. ""We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,"" she said, adding that this ""has real ramifications for the entire health care system.""
With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could ""lose their health insurance.""
In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.
Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a ""big betrayal of the American people"" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.

She also pushed back sharply
on administration arguments
that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative ""disingenuous.""

""It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.""
Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.
""We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,"" she said. ""I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.""
With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, ""That's why we need to work together to get this open.""

For weeks, the Trump administration has carried out aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, including
a recent raid of an apartment building
during which agents pulled residents, including children, out of their homes and detained some U.S. citizens.

The actions have led to tense standoffs between protestors and federal agents. A Border Patrol agent
shot a woman in the city's southwest side last week
. Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.
Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are ""political in nature."" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year,
according to WBEZ
.
Last month, Trump said he would ""love to have"" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House
to make a formal request for troops
. The president also
posted on Truth Social last month
that the city was going to find out ""why it's called the Department of WAR.""
""All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,"" Raoul said.
In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.

Why Gov. Pritzker says Trump's threats to Chicago make him worry about 2026 elections
A federal judge

Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member —
said in an interview with

if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.

""All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,"" Hayes said.
But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not ""normal times.""
""I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,"" Raoul said.
On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said ""that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.""
""It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,"" Raoul continued ""It's not what we do in the United States of America.""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.
Sponsor Message
""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.

She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.

The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.
Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.
""A room full of people from the administration,"" Kaine told reporters. Yet ""no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.""
Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.
It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.

It appears at least
one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions
, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.
However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.
""I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,"" Schiff said. ""Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.""
Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.
""The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,"" he said."

Dozens of Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — will be auctioned off in the coming months to support public television.
Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show
The Joy of Painting
. More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52.
Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
Winter's Peace
, which Bob Ross painted on-air in 1993, is among his first three works going up for auction in November. He used especially vibrant colors with his TV audience in mind.

At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to
claw back $1.1 billion
in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position.

The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the
national TV channel Create
, which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including
The Best of the Joy of Painting
(based on Ross' show),
America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and
Julia Child's

Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.
""This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,"" the auction house says.

Ross' paintings rarely hit the market
The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all ""previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes"" of

They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and ""happy trees"" that became his trademark.

The Real Bob Ross: Meet The Meticulous Artist Behind Those Happy Trees
Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.
Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Yes, this is an email asking you to buy our book early, but — because we're
Planet Money —
we're also reporting on why that matters. In fact, we are chronicling the whole process of making the book and have a few early tidbits to share.
So, first, the big news. Our book,
Planet Money: A Guide to the Economic Forces That Shape Your Life
,
is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.
Sponsor Message
It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who
preorder the book
will receive a poster that's in the book
based on our ""Laws of the Office"" episode

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.

The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.

""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
Winter's Peace

Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.

They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and ""happy trees"" that became his trademark.

Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.
Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.

It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

(On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.

The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.

Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.

Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.
Media

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.
Sponsor Message
""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.

The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.

Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.

A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told

The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?

Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

series. Today, we bring to you two cases of crime in the age of AI.
First, cybercriminals are using our own voices against us. Audio deepfake scams are picking up against individuals but also against businesses. We hear from a bank on how they’re adapting defenses, and find out how the new defenses are a game of AI vs AI.
Then, we move over to the stock market to witness AI market manipulation. A new breed of trading bots behave differently. They could collude with each other, even without human involvement or instruction, so researchers are asking how to think about blame, and regulation in a world of more sophisticated trading bots. That’s assuming regulators could even keep up with the tech in the first place.

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.
Sponsor Message
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)
Sponsor Message
NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.
Sponsor Message
Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.
Media

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""
America Reckons With Racial Injustice
Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.
Sponsor Message
""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.

Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.

Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.

This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including

and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.

But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Yes, this is an email asking you to buy our book early, but — because we're
Planet Money —
we're also reporting on why that matters. In fact, we are chronicling the whole process of making the book and have a few early tidbits to share.
So, first, the big news. Our book,
Planet Money: A Guide to the Economic Forces That Shape Your Life
,
is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.
Sponsor Message
It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who
preorder the book
will receive a poster that's in the book
based on our ""Laws of the Office"" episode
. You'll also get a month of Planet Money+ free, if you haven't already signed up. (If you are already a supporter, thank you! We'll be in touch with special offers for you. It won't matter how you buy the book.)

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

First, cybercriminals are using our own voices against us. Audio deepfake scams are picking up against individuals but also against businesses. We hear from a bank on how they’re adapting defenses, and find out how the new defenses are a game of AI vs AI.
Then, we move over to the stock market to witness AI market manipulation. A new breed of trading bots behave differently. They could collude with each other, even without human involvement or instruction, so researchers are asking how to think about blame, and regulation in a world of more sophisticated trading bots. That’s assuming regulators could even keep up with the tech in the first place.

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.
Sponsor Message
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)
Sponsor Message
NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

A reminder of her oath
On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Leigh Vogel/Getty Images
Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.
Sponsor Message
Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""

Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.

""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

Dozens of Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — will be auctioned off in the coming months to support public television.
Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show
The Joy of Painting
. More than 400 half-hour episodes aired on PBS (and eventually the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) from 1983 to 1994, the year before Ross died of cancer at age 52.
Ross' impact lives on: His show still airs on PBS and streams on platforms like Hulu

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
Winter's Peace
, which Bob Ross painted on-air in 1993, is among his first three works going up for auction in November. He used especially vibrant colors with his TV audience in mind.

The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the
national TV channel Create
, which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including
The Best of the Joy of Painting
(based on Ross' show),
America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and
Julia Child's

Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.
""This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,"" the auction house says.

Ross' paintings rarely hit the market
The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all ""previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes"" of

They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and ""happy trees"" that became his trademark.

The Real Bob Ross: Meet The Meticulous Artist Behind Those Happy Trees
Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

In August, Bonhams sold two of Ross' early 1990s mountain and lake scenes as part of an online auction of American art. They fetched $114,800 and $95,750, surpassing expectations and setting a new auction world record for Ross — at least for the time being.
""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.
Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Yes, this is an email asking you to buy our book early, but — because we're
Planet Money —
we're also reporting on why that matters. In fact, we are chronicling the whole process of making the book and have a few early tidbits to share.
So, first, the big news. Our book,
Planet Money: A Guide to the Economic Forces That Shape Your Life
,
is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.
Sponsor Message
It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who
preorder the book
will receive a poster that's in the book
based on our ""Laws of the Office"" episode

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

They could collude with each other, even without human involvement or instruction, so researchers are asking how to think about blame, and regulation in a world of more sophisticated trading bots.

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the

arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.

The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.
Sponsor Message
""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
Winter's Peace

Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.
""This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,"" the auction house says.

They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and ""happy trees"" that became his trademark.

Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.
Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.

It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.

She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.

Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.
Media

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.
Sponsor Message
""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.

Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?

Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

Our sister show, The Indicator, is chronicling the evolving business of crime for its
Vice Week
series. Today, we bring to you two cases of crime in the age of AI.
First, cybercriminals are using our own voices against us. Audio deepfake scams are picking up against individuals but also against businesses. We hear from a bank on how they’re adapting defenses, and find out how the new defenses are a game of AI vs AI.
Then, we move over to the stock market to witness AI market manipulation. A new breed of trading bots behave differently. They could collude with each other, even without human involvement or instruction, so researchers are asking how to think about blame, and regulation in a world of more sophisticated trading bots. That’s assuming regulators could even keep up with the tech in the first place.

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.
Sponsor Message
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)
Sponsor Message
NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.
Sponsor Message
Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.
Media

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""
America Reckons With Racial Injustice
Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.
Sponsor Message
""The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,"" Weiss writes.
In a
note to CBS News staffers
obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.
Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.

Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said

Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including

has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.

""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Yes, this is an email asking you to buy our book early, but — because we're
Planet Money —
we're also reporting on why that matters. In fact, we are chronicling the whole process of making the book and have a few early tidbits to share.
So, first, the big news. Our book,
Planet Money: A Guide to the Economic Forces That Shape Your Life
,
is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.
Sponsor Message
It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who
preorder the book
will receive a poster that's in the book
based on our ""Laws of the Office"" episode
. You'll also get a month of Planet Money+ free, if you haven't already signed up. (If you are already a supporter, thank you! We'll be in touch with special offers for you. It won't matter how you buy the book.)

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

First, cybercriminals are using our own voices against us. Audio deepfake scams are picking up against individuals but also against businesses. We hear from a bank on how they’re adapting defenses, and find out how the new defenses are a game of AI vs AI.
Then, we move over to the stock market to witness AI market manipulation. A new breed of trading bots behave differently. They could collude with each other, even without human involvement or instruction, so researchers are asking how to think about blame, and regulation in a world of more sophisticated trading bots. That’s assuming regulators could even keep up with the tech in the first place.

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.
Sponsor Message
2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)
Sponsor Message
NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

A reminder of her oath
On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Leigh Vogel/Getty Images
Paramount announced Monday that it is acquiring The Free Press — a provocative news site known for criticizing mainstream media and left-leaning ""woke"" culture — and installing the publication's co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.
""As of today, I am editor-in-chief of CBS News, working with new colleagues on the programs that have impacted American culture for generations — shows like
60 Minutes
and
Sunday Morning
— and shaping how millions of Americans read, listen, watch, and, most importantly, understand the news in the 21st century,"" Weiss wrote in a Monday
letter to readers
.
It's a significant step in the meteoric rise of the 41-year-old journalist and entrepreneur, who spent years as an op-ed editor at the
Wall Street Journal
and
New York Times
before her emphatic disavowal of traditional media organizations.
Sponsor Message
Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.
Sponsor Message
The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people,
according to Paramount
, and is backed by a
slew of big names
, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.
Media
Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.
Sponsor Message
Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.
Media

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

Head Of 'New York Times' Editorial Page Steps Down Amid Controversy
""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times
,"" Weiss told the
Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.
Sponsor Message
Many of Weiss'
Times
columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.
Sponsor Message
Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics
Hundreds of celebrities relaunch a McCarthy-era committee to defend free speech
Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served.

Dozens of Bob Ross paintings — many of them created live on the PBS series that made him a household name — will be auctioned off in the coming months to support public television.
Ross, with his distinctive afro, soothing voice and sunny outlook, empowered millions of viewers to make and appreciate art through his show

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
Winter's Peace
, which Bob Ross painted on-air in 1993, is among his first three works going up for auction in November. He used especially vibrant colors with his TV audience in mind.

How the offering could benefit public broadcasters
At President Trump's direction, Congress voted in July to
claw back $1.1 billion
in previously allocated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), leaving the country's roughly 330 PBS and 244 NPR stations in a precarious position.

The Ross auction aims to help stations pay their licensing fees to the
national TV channel Create
, which in turn allows them to air popular public television programs including
The Best of the Joy of Painting
(based on Ross' show),
America's Test Kitchen, Rick Steve's Europe and
Julia Child's

.
Bonhams says the auction proceeds will help stations — particularly smaller and rural ones — defray the cost burden of licensing fees, making Create available to more of them.
""This enables stations to maintain their educational programming while redirecting funds toward other critical operations and local content production threatened by federal funding cuts,"" the auction house says.

Ross' paintings rarely hit the market
The 30 paintings going up for sale span Ross' career and are all ""previously unseen by the public except during their creation in individual episodes"" of
The Joy of Painting,
according to Bonhams. Many have remained in secure storage ever since.
They include vibrant landscapes, with the serene mountains, lake views and ""happy trees"" that became his trademark.

The Real Bob Ross: Meet The Meticulous Artist Behind Those Happy Trees
Ross started painting during his 20-year career in the Air Force, much of which was spent in Alaska. That experience shaped his penchant for landscapes and ability to work quickly — and,
he later said
, his desire not to raise his voice once out of the service.
Once on the airwaves, Ross' soft-spoken guidance and gentle demeanor won over millions of viewers. His advice applied to art as well as life: Mistakes are just ""happy accidents,"" talent is a ""pursued interest,"" and it's important to ""take a step back and look.""

""With his market continuing to climb, proceeds benefiting American Public Television, and many of the paintings created live on air — a major draw for collectors — we expect spirited bidding and results that could surpass previous records,"" Robin Starr, the general manager of its subsidiary Bonhams Skinner, told NPR in a statement.
Bonhams estimates that the next 30 paintings could go for a combined total between $850,000 and $1.4 million.

Gold has broken
yet another record
this week, illustrating just how anxious investors are about the health of the U.S. economy.
Politics
Beyond 'draining the swamp': How Trump is knocking down checks on presidential power
This week, the price of gold hit $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.
The precious metal is usually seen as a ""safe haven"" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including
upending global trade
and
threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve.
On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly
shrugged off
this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.
Sponsor Message
But at the same time, the
value of the U.S. dollar
has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.
""Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,"" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.
""Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,"" he added.
Law
Unease grows at the Justice Department as Trump's threats get even more blunt
Now gold is having its hottest year in
nearly half a century
— since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.
And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs
predicted
that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.
Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls ""upside risk"").
""While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,"" Struyven says
Gold may be known as a ""safe haven"" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it
Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the ""fear trade."" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.
Sponsor Message
""When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,"" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta,
told NPR this spring
.
But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.
2025 government shutdown
As the shutdown drags on, the threat of permanent cuts is mired in politics
There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.
For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.
More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.
""Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,"" he says. ""Diversification matters."""

Yes, this is an email asking you to buy our book early, but — because we're
Planet Money —
we're also reporting on why that matters. In fact, we are chronicling the whole process of making the book and have a few early tidbits to share.
So, first, the big news. Our book,
Planet Money: A Guide to the Economic Forces That Shape Your Life
,
is here.
Preorder it today and get a special gift
.
Preorders are incredibly helpful for authors. If you are buying books to support them, preorders give them an extra boost that can become a snowball. Booksellers look at preorder numbers when they are deciding on things like which titles get the sweet, sweet spot in the window, which are at the top of their website or even just how many copies to stock. They want to pick winners their customers will like, and strong preorders are a predictor of that.
Sponsor Message
The preorders also all count as first-day sales, so big preorders increase the chance of starting out on a bestseller list, which then leads to more sales and … you can see the snowball.
These are just a couple of the many things we've learned about the book business throughout this yearslong journey to make our first book. We'll be sharing more about our adventures in upcoming episodes, as we get closer to the publication date in the spring.
But, you might be wondering, what's actually in the book?
A preview of the
Planet Money
book
Our book is filled with brand-new stories about all the economic forces that affect our lives — from work and career; to saving and investing; to food, dating and family; to travel (if you count a world tour of the greatest public goods to ever exist). We also revisit some classic episodes and people we met from years back to bring you the updates many of you have asked for.
We've pushed ourselves to make this as creative as possible
as a physical book
. There are beautiful (and weird) full-color illustrations and hand-drawn graphics. There are postcards and a love letter hiding inside. But mostly it's good, old-fashioned stories about people who have to make decisions that matter and what those stories reveal about the big economic ideas that shape our lives.
Sponsor Message
It's written by Alex Mayyasi (his writing inspired some classic
episodes like this one
) and features work from more co-hosts than we have space to list here. We are all so proud of how it turned out. It will grip you, delight you, make you want to turn every page. And we hope that by the end, it will leave you a little more confident making important decisions in your own life — not just about money, but about anything where evidence, principles and a rational, analytical mindset might help.
But that's not all that's in it for you. If you preorder, you get gifts!
People who
preorder the book
will receive a poster that's in the book
based on our ""Laws of the Office"" episode

Black-owned media outlets are grappling with the same financial headwinds affecting much of journalism — including declining ad revenue, uncertain digital business models and the challenge of connecting with audiences through video. But their obstacles are also distinct.
While Black Americans are among the country's most engaged news consumers, they make up a smaller share of the U.S. population and often have less disposable income to spend on media subscriptions.
Those pressures have pushed several Black-owned outlets to scale back, fold or reinvent themselves. Yet the appetite for journalism that captures the full scope of Black life in America is still there. Ashley Allison hopes to reimagine that space.
Sponsor Message
A Democratic political strategist and CNN commentator, Allison is the founder of Watering Hole Media, the company that recently acquired the digital media outlet The Root from G/O Media. The acquisition marks the online magazine's return to Black ownership for the first time in years. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.
She says The Root's founding in 2008, the year Barack Obama was elected, captured a moment of new energy around digital storytelling.
""The Root's purpose was to bring news to Black audiences through a digital platform. It was extremely successful in its founding.""
""That campaign really used social and digital media to connect to a piece of the electorate that sometimes felt left aside by mainstream media,"" Allison told
Morning Edition
. In an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Allison shared her thoughts on the future of The Root and how it will navigate the current challenges being faced by media companies.
Interview highlights
Michel Martin:
The Root has changed ownership several times since it was founded in 2008. In 2015, Graham Holdings sold it to Univision. Then in 2019, it changed hands again and went to a company that used to be called Gawker, now G/O Media. Has something been lost with the change of hands, in your view?
Sponsor Message
Ashley Allison:
I think every owner has a vision for what they want the publication to be, including myself. So I can't really speak to what those folks wanted to do, but I know in this moment, we look at this platform as an opportunity not just to tell Black stories and talk about the Black experience in this country. The reason people keep wanting to buy this outlet is because it's a successful one that can thrive in this economy.
Martin:
This is a moment of intense pressure and scrutiny on media companies. Have you thought about that, and how do you plan to address that?
Allison:
I think anyone who works in journalism has thought about that. But it cannot deter us from standing in truth and facts. We want to be rooted in data, in science and in truth. There is a place for commentary and opinion, for sure, but all of that commentary, we will not be a site that pushes mis- or disinformation. We just have to stand and draw a line in the sand.
Martin:
What is your benchmark of success?
Allison:
We want our readers to continue to engage with our writing and our video. We want to be not just an online publication, but also an offline one. We've done in-person activations, but we want to go into communities, talk to people and engage. Most importantly, when people look at The Root, I want it to do what it did for me: give you a blueprint to be aspirational and inspirational and know that anything is possible, even if you haven't already encountered it."

As the federal government appeared headed for a shutdown early last week, Jenna Norton joined a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to urge lawmakers not to be cowed by the Trump administration's threat of mass layoffs.
""As a federal worker, I am here to tell you that every awful thing that would happen in a shutdown — shuttering programs that Americans rely on, damaging our economy, firing federal workers — all of this is already happening,"" said Norton, a program director with the National Institutes of Health, who spoke in her personal capacity alongside other civil servants.

2025 government shutdown
The federal government is shut down. Here's what that means across the country
Noting that the Supreme Court has largely allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its agenda, Norton called on lawmakers to step in.
""Congress is the only remaining chance we have to stop the gutting of public services Americans depend on,"" she said.
Now furloughed, Norton continues to implore members of Congress to reject a spending deal that maintains the status quo. Instead, she hopes they'll use the moment to assert their constitutional authority — their power of the purse — to take back control of government spending.
""They accepted a position of power and privilege of representing the American people,"" Norton said in an interview with NPR. ""If they're serious about doing that, they need to stand up and represent the American people and push back against a president who wants to be king.""
Shining a light on what has already happened
Almost a week into the shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees are furloughed. Far more, including members of the U.S. military, are working without pay.
Meanwhile, President Trump, his budget director Russell Vought and other administration officials have reiterated
threats of mass layoffs
and program cuts, going so far as to announce a
halt to federal projects
largely affecting states led by Democrats. On Sunday night, Trump insisted that layoffs were already underway.

""That's taking place right now, and it's all because of the Democrats,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House, without offering specifics as to which departments had initiated staffing cuts. (On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was referring to the hundreds of thousands of employees who have been furloughed.)

NPR has not learned of any layoffs due to the shutdown since congressional appropriations lapsed on Oct. 1, although many federal agencies have filed reorganization and reduction-in-force plans with the administration as a result of a
February executive order
and subsequent guidance directing them to do so.
Living Better
The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot
Norton fears she could be laid off during the shutdown or fired for speaking out. NIH staff have previously been told not to speak with the media, and many of the federal employees NPR has spoken with about the current administration do not want to be identified by name, fearing retaliation.
Still, Norton believes she not only has a right to speak out on matters of public interest, she has an obligation to put up a red flag when she sees harm. And right now, she says, the situation inside the government is far worse than most Americans realize.
Jenna Norton sees this moment as an opportunity to shine a light on what agencies like NIH have already lost.

""I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy. We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public,"" she said.
In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Americans were being harmed by Democrats — and federal workers like Norton who oppose the president.
""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing,"" Jackson wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""
Funding for research into health disparities has been cut
Norton's work at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of NIH, is focused on health disparities. She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.
Sponsor Message
She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.
She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.
And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its
purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts
across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as ""structural racism.""
Politics
A judge ruled their firings were illegal. The government got to do it anyway
Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them,
finding the terminations unlawful
.
""I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,"" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to
a court transcript
. ""I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.""
The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court
vacated the key part of Judge Young's order
, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.
Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff
Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH
announced in the spring
followed a similar pattern. As part of
a broader ruling
, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal. Then, the Supreme Court stepped in and
allowed the layoffs to continue
, for now.
That paved the way to a gutting of NIH's policy staff, who liaise with Congress, and its communications teams — essentially, their doorway to communicate with the public, Norton says. Without those colleagues, her team is unable to update its website to post meeting minutes or research discoveries.
Sponsor Message
Norton says she understands why the Trump administration would want to control information coming out of the agencies.
""Because information is power,"" she says. ""To me, this isn't really a partisan Democrats versus Republicans issue. This is a democracy versus autocracy issue.""

On her left wrist, Norton wears a set of Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelets. Instead of song titles or lyrics, the bracelets spell out ""Support the Constitution"" and ""NIH"" along with other federal agencies.
They were a gift from a former colleague worried about what's happening within the government.
""They're just a little memento of our commitment to our oath of office, which is to serve the Constitution and to serve the American people,"" Norton says.
They're also a daily reminder of why she's choosing to speak out. It hasn't been easy. She knows many Americans don't share her view of the current administration, including some members of her own family.
""My parents voted for Trump, so I understand that people who support Trump aren't bad people, and they want the same things that I want,"" she says, including things like financial stability and opportunities for their kids.
Norton also wants her kids to grow up in a world where they can speak freely. She worries that's no longer a guarantee.

Media
Bari Weiss joins CBS with a mandate for 'balanced and fact-based' news
Weiss left the
Times
in 2020 after many in the newsroom expressed outrage over its
publication of a controversial op-ed
by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy
resignation letter
, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the
Times
was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.
Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year,
calling it
a ""new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.""
The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like
gender-affirming health care
,
COVID-19 lockdowns
,
DEI programs
and
J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views
.
It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner
published his essay
arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.

Press freedom 'no longer a given' in the U.S., says journalism nonprofit. Here's why
""As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,"" Weiss wrote on Monday. ""This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.""
The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as
NPR has reported
, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.
But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a
merger that required Trump administration approval
— it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.
""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison
said in a statement
, calling the move ""part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.""
Here's what else to know about Weiss.
What is Weiss' background?
Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and
had her Bat Mitzvah
at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the
2018 mass shooting
that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.

Weiss attended Columbia University (where,
she says
, she dated future
Saturday Night Live
star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was
part of a group of Jewish students
who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.
While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.

It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called
How to Fight Anti-Semitism
, which was published in 2019.
After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the
Wall Street Journal
in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later
told Reason
that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were ""too anti-Trump.""

""It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,"" Weiss told the magazine.
The
New York Times
hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.
""I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at
The Wall Street Journal
, to being the most right-winged person at
The New York Times

Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle
later that year.

Many of Weiss'

columns garnered controversy — like a
2017 defense of cultural appropriation
, a
2018 defense
of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced
#MeToo accusations
, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee
Brett Kavanaugh
should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled ""
We're All Fascists Now
.""
But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the
Times
ran the
op-ed by Cotton
— the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an ""overwhelming show of force."" Hundreds of
Times
staffers signed a letter
protesting the piece
, which an editor's note later said ""fell short of our standards and should not have been published."" Bennet resigned within days.
Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication,
tweeted about the fallout
as a ""civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals"" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020,
Weiss resigned
in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing ""bullying by colleagues"" and an ""illiberal environment.""
""The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,"" she wrote. ""Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.""

How does Weiss identify politically?
The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally
publishing critical pieces
and most recently
objecting to its ""coercion"" of ABC
to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.
Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.

Over the years, she has described herself as a ""
radical centrist
"" and a ""
Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person
."" In a 2024
TED Talk
, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.
CBS is the latest news giant to bend to Trump's power
She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, ""so much so that I'm actually in one myself."" (Weiss married Bowles, a former
Times
tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)
But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.
""I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,"" Weiss said in the same speech. ""And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.""
Why is she returning to legacy media?
In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: ""Why flee
The New York Times
only to head back into another legacy institution?""
She says that while she was ""raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,"" she found in 2020 that ""the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.""
Politics

Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, ""as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another"" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.
Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — ""an America-loathing far left"" and a ""history-erasing far right"" — and says the majority of ""smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans"" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.

Those include holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny,"" embracing ""a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate"" and respecting ""our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads."""

The Lasting Legacy Of Bob Ross And His Colorful World Of 'Happy Accidents'
Now, the nonprofit syndicator American Public Television (APT) is auctioning off 30 of Ross' paintings to raise money for public broadcasters hit by federal funding cuts. APT has pledged to direct 100% of its net sales proceeds to APT and PBS stations nationwide, auction house Bonhams said in a statement.
Bonhams is calling this the ""largest single offering of Bob Ross original works ever brought to market."" Ross has become synonymous with public broadcasting — some activists have
even invoked him
in their calls for restoring federal funding to it.
""Bob Ross dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone through public television,"" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross, Inc. ""This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.""
The first three paintings will be auctioned in Los Angeles
on Nov. 11
. The rest will be sold throughout 2026 at Bonham's salerooms in Los Angeles, New York and Boston.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu

""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.

From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge

Thinkers, dreamers, doers: Here's who made the 2025 MacArthur Fellow list
To explore this question, she conducts much of her fieldwork in southwest Madagascar, ""a place where the coral reef, very clear blue waters, meet a dry desert vegetation scape,"" she says. ""It's the most amazing landscape I've ever been in.""
This corner of the island nation is inhabited by a diverse mosaic of human communities — and has been for millennia. Some focus on fishing in the ocean or among the mangroves, others on herding zebu cattle, and still others on harvesting resources from the forest.

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.

In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.

To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""
Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, believes that the ways the historic people of Madagascar handled environmental change hold lessons for us all.

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.
Two psychiatry organizations — the
Southern California Psychiatry Society
and the recently formed grassroots
Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
— have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.

HHS responds
""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for,"" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.
The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most,""

Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."
health,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.

""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Ultraprocessed food in the spotlight
Ultra-processed foods are under scrutiny by the Trump administration.

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?
It's unclear where the new guidelines will land on alcohol but the lead up to weighing the issue has sparked controversy.

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall
, who leads the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance and advocates for more public awareness around the harms of drinking, worries industry pressure will lead to a softer recommendation in the guidelines.

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""
Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, believes that the ways the historic people of Madagascar handled environmental change hold lessons for us all.

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Two psychiatry organizations — the

The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.

In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""
health,"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this

While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.

Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""

Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.

The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.

Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.

Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""
health,"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.

Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""

Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.

Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis

Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.

The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.
Two psychiatry organizations — the
Southern California Psychiatry Society
and the recently formed grassroots
Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
— have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.
""As physicians committed to evidence-based care, we are alarmed by the direction of HHS under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr,"" the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
said in a statement
.

HHS responds
""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for,"" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.
The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

RFK Jr. is shrinking the agency that works on mental illness and addiction
""RFK Jr. is trying to eliminate the federal agency that is responsible for supporting states and localities with overdose prevention,"" says
Dr. Eric Rafla-Yuan,
a San Diego-based psychiatrist and a member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health. ""This is exactly opposite of the direction that we need to be going.""
Psychiatric medications questioned
Both of the organizations are also concerned about the health secretary's attacks on psychiatric medications, including in the Make Our Children Healthy Again strategy, which is also known as The MAHA report

The MAHA report
""specifically misrepresents the data on psychotropic medications, really ignoring the full body of the scientific literature,"" says
Dr. Emily Wood
, co-chair of the Southern California Psychiatric Association. ""And it is calling for various ways to limit access to psychiatric medications, which is extremely disturbing as these are medications that are critical for many individuals with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, ADHD and many disorders.""
""This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most,""
according to the statement
by the Southern California Psychiatric Association. ""The report uses these inaccurate statements as a basis for taking action to restrict access to critical services that ease suffering, restore functioning, and prevent suicide.""

An FDA panel spread misinformation about SSRI use in pregnancy, alarming doctors
Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."
health,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""
health,"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.

Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.
Your Health
What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Ultraprocessed food in the spotlight

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""

In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.
Two psychiatry organizations — the
Southern California Psychiatry Society
and the recently formed grassroots
Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
— have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.
""As physicians committed to evidence-based care, we are alarmed by the direction of HHS under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr,"" the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
said in a statement
.

HHS responds
""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for,"" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.
The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""And it is calling for various ways to limit access to psychiatric medications, which is extremely disturbing as these are medications that are critical for many individuals with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, ADHD and many disorders.""
""This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most,""
according to the statement
by the Southern California Psychiatric Association. ""The report uses these inaccurate statements as a basis for taking action to restrict access to critical services that ease suffering, restore functioning, and prevent suicide.""

An FDA panel spread misinformation about SSRI use in pregnancy, alarming doctors
Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."
health,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."

She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""

Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.

""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.

""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.
Your Health
What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.

To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""

Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.
Two psychiatry organizations — the
Southern California Psychiatry Society
and the recently formed grassroots
Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
— have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.
""As physicians committed to evidence-based care, we are alarmed by the direction of HHS under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr,"" the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
said in a statement
.

HHS responds
""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for,"" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.
The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most,""
according to the statement
by the Southern California Psychiatric Association. ""The report uses these inaccurate statements as a basis for taking action to restrict access to critical services that ease suffering, restore functioning, and prevent suicide.""

Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."

An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.

Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.

She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.
Your Health
What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""

But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.

In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""

Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.

To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""
Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, believes that the ways the historic people of Madagascar handled environmental change hold lessons for us all.

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.
Shots - Health News
Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Psychiatrists have joined other public health groups in calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.
Two psychiatry organizations — the
Southern California Psychiatry Society
and the recently formed grassroots
Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
— have released statements saying that the actions of the leader of the Department of Health and Human Services have increased stigma, instilled fear and hurt access to mental health and addiction care.
""As physicians committed to evidence-based care, we are alarmed by the direction of HHS under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr,"" the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health
said in a statement
.

HHS responds
""Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump's promise to Make America Healthy Again by dismantling the failed status quo, restoring public trust in health institutions, and ensuring the transparency, accountability, and decision-making power the American people voted for,"" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the federal health department, wrote to NPR in an email.
The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""This misrepresentation increases stigma, spreads fear, and can keep people from reaching out for help when they need it most,""
according to the statement
by the Southern California Psychiatric Association. ""The report uses these inaccurate statements as a basis for taking action to restrict access to critical services that ease suffering, restore functioning, and prevent suicide.""

Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.

""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.

in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.

At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.
Your Health
What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?
It's unclear where the new guidelines will land on alcohol but the lead up to weighing the issue has sparked controversy.

A growing body of research points to a link between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of

stroke
and

. What's still debatable is the
exact threshold
at which risks increase.
Shots - Health News
Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall
, who leads the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance and advocates for more public awareness around the harms of drinking, worries industry pressure will lead to a softer recommendation in the guidelines.

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""
Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, believes that the ways the historic people of Madagascar handled environmental change hold lessons for us all.

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

Two psychiatry organizations — the

The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""
His group is calling on lawmakers to replace Kennedy with someone trained in public health and evidence-based care. ""To protect patients, safeguard scientific integrity, and restore public trust, we join our colleagues in calling on the President to remove Secretary Kennedy and appoint a qualified, evidence-driven leader without delay,"" according to the statement."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""

Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""
health,"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the
2025 scientific report
hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbs.
But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.
In public appearances, he has
disparaged
the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document ""incomprehensible"" and ""Biden guidelines."" (In reality the
most recent guidelines
were issued in 2020 during President Trump's first term.)
And Kennedy has
pledged
the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on ""whole foods, healthy foods and local foods.""
If he follows through on this promise, it will cause ""substantial chaos,"" says
Kevin Klatt
, a nutrition research scientist at UC Berkeley.
Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called ""
MyPlate
."" In reality they function primarily as a policy document.

Are beef tallow fries any healthier? These nutritionists say don't kid yourself
They contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches, and what's served in military bases and federal prisons.
""Replacing that with a four-page consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?"" says Klatt. ""There's no way that that can hold any policy weight.""
Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the
MAHA strategy report
and said they ""will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format.""

There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says
Frank Hu
, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.
""The question is how to deal with it?"" he says.
As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this
, in part, to the ""technical language"" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.
While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.
""I think that's a fantasy,"" says Klatt. ""We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines.""
And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.
Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.

On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Ultraprocessed food in the spotlight

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.
Shots - Health News
From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.
Softening alcohol guidance?

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall
, who leads the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance and advocates for more public awareness around the harms of drinking, worries industry pressure will lead to a softer recommendation in the guidelines.

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

""Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.
Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.
Sponsor Message
The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.
In recent years, the federal government had taken a leading role in funding efforts to address serious mental illness and substance use through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administrations (SAMHSA), notes
Dr. Steven Sharfstein
, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
Those efforts had started to pay off, he adds. ""There's been great progress in reducing the number of overdose deaths in the country as a result of these initiatives,"" he says.
But the firing of staff at SAMHSA earlier this year and the health secretary's efforts to shutter the agency have hurt those efforts, says Sharfstein, who's also a founding member of the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health.

""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.

Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""

The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.
The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.
Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.

The MAHA plan for healthier kids includes 128 ideas, but few details
The advice in the

But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.

As it stands, most of the public doesn't actually follow the guidelines.
The Trump administration has
attributed this

While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.

Saturated fat and meat could get another look
Will the dietary guidelines embrace saturated fat and red meat?

Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.
The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of
evidence showing
this kind of fat can
increase cholesterol
, which can increase heart disease risk.
And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.
But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it,
describing his own eating habits
as ""a carnivore diet.""
He's
touted
Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight their
switch
from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July
meeting with governors
in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be ""common sense"" and ""stress the need to eat saturated fats,"" including dairy, ""good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.""
Sponsor Message
Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.
And in recent years, researchers have started
looking into
low-carb, higher fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.
The
evidence for the link
between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs
is also problematic
,
and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.
Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.
At this point,
Frank Hu
of Harvard doesn't see a rationale to ""make a major shift"" in dietary recommendations.
""Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really,"" he says.
Whole fat dairy vs. skim milk
Current guidelines emphasize low-fat dairy but some expect full-fat options to get a nod in the new guidelines.

Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also
championed
full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the ""attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt"" in the new guidelines.
That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.
As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse
the complex relationships
between dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to
rethink the issue.

What kind of dairy does a body good? Science is updating the answer
Richard Bruno
, a professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting ""consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease.""
Bruno is among the researchers who argue the data don't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.
Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues
Benoît Lamarche, who
directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a
recent effort
to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.
Sponsor Message
On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.
But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers, and other foods that are ""loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats.""
Beans and legumes may get dissed
This year's scientific report recommends the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.
Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.
That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. ""Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein,"" he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get
enough fiber
in their diets.
In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz
wrote an op-ed
in the
Wall Street Journal
titled ""Meat Will Make America Healthy Again"" urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed she argues that ""most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids"" and are harder to absorb.
But Gardner points out you can
get all your essential amino acids
from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be ""complete"" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to
less chronic disease

Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're
""poisoning""
Americans and blaming them for the chronic disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission
report
states that they've led ""to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives.""
The Trump administration
committed
to developing a ""government-wide definition"" for ultraprocessed food.
But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.
""We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition, and obesity, but the relationship was limited,"" says
Deanna Hoelscher
, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.

From anxiety to cancer, the evidence against ultra-processed food piles up
The report authors noted there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.
Barbara Schneeman
, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients and then there's the actual processing.
""If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium,"" she says, ""But
we really have little to no information on the processing side of it.""
And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that ""are actually beneficial for our health"" even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.

Is one drink a day OK? Here's what to consider
The current guidelines advise up to one
drink a day for women and two for men
.
In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks
start to increase
""even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.""
Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were
quick to criticize
that study after the draft was released in January — and called for it to be ""disregarded.""
And that seems to have happened.
Katherine Keyes
, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.
""To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity,"" she says.
Meanwhile, the
other report
on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with ""high certainty"" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.
It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Those findings don't support actually
recommending
alcohol for health, says
Dr. Ned Calonge
, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no ""safe levels of alcohol.""
Mike Marshall

And she believes that through the numerous shards of pottery and fragments of bone that she and her colleagues have unearthed, the historic people of this part of Madagascar may well have lessons from which we can all learn.
A revealing bike trip
Douglass' parents worked in international development and public health, which meant that she and her three siblings grew up all over the world — in Cameroon, Kenya, Rwanda and Ukraine. But they spent the longest stretch of time, about a decade, in the central highlands of Madagascar, a landscape of terraced rice fields and stout pyramids of freshly baked bricks.
Sponsor Message
In the eighth grade, she and her classmates went on a three-week, nearly 400-mile mountain biking trip along the remote Masoala Peninsula in the northeast. ""I will never understand the bravery of the teacher,"" Douglass says with admiration. As she careened down muddy slopes in the rainforest, she was struck by towering limestone cliffs and the dizzying abundance of biodiversity.
""But what I remember the most about that trip,"" she says, ""is getting to stop in small communities along the way and hearing people talk about the issues that they were facing.""
While growing up in Madagascar, Douglass had heard the pervasive idea that rural communities like those on the peninsula were intent on cutting down the last remnants of pristine forest for slash and burn agriculture. But on that biking trip, she encountered a different reality.
The Malagasy she met lived in close relationship with their environment, relying on local fisheries and using plants for food, medicine and materials. In other words, ""they were part of that ecosystem, not an external threat to it,"" Douglass says. ""Life there was nothing like what people were saying life there was like.""
It's a lesson that embedded itself within her.
Later, as a Ph.D. student at Yale University, Douglass was drawn to know more about ""who the early Malagasy were and how they interacted with [their] environment,"" she says.
She began by investigating what drove the ancient megafauna of Madagascar to extinction about a thousand years ago. These animals included ""giant lemurs the size of an adult human, large crocodiles and pygmy hippopotamuses, and an animal near and dear to my heart — the elephant bird,"" she says. ""The largest of these [birds] would have towered over 10 feet tall, weighed over one ton and laid eggs that are roughly 180 times the size of a chicken egg.""
Sponsor Message
Researchers had suggested that this extraordinary array of creatures was decimated through hunting by the people who originally settled the island. But she found that explanation unsatisfying. ""The amount of evidence that we have in the archaeological record — in the form of animal bones or other remains that testified to the relationships people had with these animals — were pretty scarce,"" she says.
Thinking back to what she learned from her mountain biking experience, Douglass decided to go see for herself. She traveled to southwest Madagascar and, working with Malagasy collaborators, went ""looking through the trash from ancient kitchens to understand if people really did hunt these animals to extinction,"" she says.
Douglass and her research team found little evidence to support the idea. Instead,
they concluded
that multiple indirect and overlapping pressures may have led to the large animals' demise, including competition over fresh water with domesticated livestock and reductions in habitat due to changes in climate and vegetation.
Douglass advises against starting from the assumption that people arrive somewhere and immediately begin to degrade the environment. ""It's always more complicated than that,"" she says. ""People become part of a place, shaping conditions for themselves and for other beings.""
Thinking that Indigenous people inevitably ruin the natural world has led to policies that ""protect plants, animals, environments from local people,"" she says. And because ""Indigenous communities, local communities are some of the most important guardians and stewards of biodiversity worldwide, you're essentially evicting people who have been key stewards of those landscapes and seascapes over many generations.""
Douglass believes that the kind of archaeology she's doing can provide a clearer picture of how human communities have co-evolved alongside the natural world around them — and that such an understanding will help inform how we think about preserving our planet today.
Out of the shards, a message
Douglass continued studying how the Malagasy have interacted with and adapted to their changing environment and climate over time.
Sponsor Message
To puzzle that out, Douglass looked for clues of social identity and affiliation among ancient artifacts. If ceramic cooking pots from different locations were made out of the same clay or decorated similarly, for instance, that would suggest there may have been social linkages between the communities that fashioned the pots. The same thing goes for the kinds of shells that people made into beads.
""These aren't the same ways that we might map out community affiliations today,"" says Douglass. ""Today, we might turn to Facebook and see if people have the same interest groups. But in a way, we're using a similar approach. We're trying to identify signals in materials that people leave behind that suggests that they had links to one another.""

This work revealed a key strategy that has enabled communities in southwest Madagascar to handle change historically —
the maintaining of a diverse social network
. Such a network allows ""people to lean on different kinds of relationships with other communities at different times, depending on their needs,"" Douglass says, especially during periods of difficulty.
Learning from trash
Douglass has also excavated ancient, discarded kitchen waste, including the remains of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals and domesticated livestock. (This is an example, she says, of archaeologists doing the best they can to use tiny fragments to reconstruct the past and make ""a lot out of a little."") Those food remains shifted over time, revealing a second tactic that communities in this part of the world have employed to handle change: the capacity to ""[weave] together
different skills and sources of subsistence
,"" Douglass says. In other words, people have shifted between coastal fishing, dry forest harvesting and hunting based on the local conditions.
A third strategy that emerged out of surveying sites across the landscape is
one of mobility
. ""Knowing that if there is a climate downturn, if there's a drought in the area that you rely on, you have the option to move,"" says Douglass. ""And you move near and far depending on the circumstances.""
Sponsor Message
Combined, she says these three notions of mobility, flexible livelihood and diverse social networks point to a broader lesson that communities today can
learn from the historic people of Madagascar
. ""When you're dealing with environmental and climate change,"" Douglass says, ""you want to have the biggest basket of potential strategies as possible to pick from and the flexibility to pick what is going to work best in that particular moment in that particular place.""
Douglass admits that the scale of planetwide change that we're witnessing now is more extreme than in the past and that it's compounded by gaping global inequality. This combination of forces challenges the livelihoods and adaptability of people everywhere, including in Madagascar. ""So that led me to think a lot about knowledge transmission"" across many generations, she says. ""How do people pass on information about the experiences that allowed them to successfully adapt and survive change?""
She concludes that, no matter our lineage, we all carry precious knowledge, including ""ecological insights, oral histories, embodied practices. Knowledge flows through many channels, including ancestral lines, lived experiences, stories, and landscapes."" Douglass contemplates not just how societies adapt to change, but how they transmit that wisdom and information, especially through music, movement, and communal feasts.
""If your community has traditions like that, it is likely part of a deeply rooted adaptive capacity,"" she says. ""Adaptation can also be joy and celebration and so many other things. And I believe that if we invest more in the kinds of practices that build community, we're going to be in a much stronger place to deal with the changes that are coming.""
Douglass says her multifaceted identity, forged across multiple countries as a young person and being forever surrounded by diverse communities, has given her a kind of stamina to weave together the fragmentary strands of knowledge and history buried in Madagascar.

Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.
For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit.
Ross Boyce
used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.
""It seems sort of an obvious thing to do,"" he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated
bed nets
can only protect kids while they're sleeping.
Sponsor Message
So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.
Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. ""That was probably overkill,"" says Boyce. ""But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?""
The answer: a resounding yes. ""It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations,"" says Boyce.
Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group,
a reduction of about 65%
.
""It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so,"" says
Thomas Eisele
, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.
""We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools,"" says Eisele. ""These types of interventions are going to be critical.""
Goats and Soda
New malaria vaccine delivered for the first time
The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry.
Permethrin
can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.
""When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin,"" he says.
Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.
""Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered,"" he says, ""but we know getting malaria is not good for children either.""
Sponsor Message
In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.
Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.
However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author
Edgar Mulogo
, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. ""The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous,"" he says. He heard one participant say ""when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."""

2025 government shutdown
GOP blames government shutdown on health care for undocumented people. That's false
With less than a month to go before many Americans pick next year's health insurance plan, Democrats in Congress are
holding up government funding
to pressure Republicans into extending billions of dollars in federal tax credits that have in recent years dramatically lowered premiums and contributed to record-low rates of uninsured Americans.
Democrats see the high-stakes standoff as a chance to talk about affordable health care as millions of Americans — including those enrolled in coverage through workplace or Medicare — brace for higher costs next year. Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.
2025 government shutdown
What's behind the health care fight that led to the government shutdown
Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But
a new KFF analysis
shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.
Open enrollment for 2026
The shutdown
coincides with open enrollment season
, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay
more than double
if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.

Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.

Time is short for an ACA premium fix in the shutdown fight, says GOP insurance leader
From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.
Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.
""I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,"" Tyer said.
Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.
This isn't the first shutdown over health care
The ACA, though, has been
a political flashpoint since 2010
, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and
spurred a government shutdown in 2013
, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders
again tried to repeal it in 2017
to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.

The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.
Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans."

The Southern California Psychiatry Society represents more than 1,000 clinicians; the Committee to Protect Public Mental Health has just over 50 members.

An FDA panel spread misinformation about SSRI use in pregnancy, alarming doctors
Dr. Sharfstein says he's also concerned about the impact of cuts to Medicaid on people with serious mental illness (SMIs), which includes conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly 6% of American adults live with an SMI. Given the debilitating nature of SMIs, patients tend to be poor, explains Sharfstein.
""They can't afford the medications,"" he says. ""And Medicaid is what they rely on. But it's not just medications. It's outpatient treatment. It's access to acute inpatient care.""
As cuts to Medicaid roll out, access to care for mental illness and addiction will get increasingly ""compromised,"" says Sharfstein. ""And we'll see a kind of rolling crisis occur.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.
Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.
Public Health
5 new members added to CDC vaccine advisory panel ahead of key meeting
Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called ""shared decision-making,""or ""individual-based decision-making"" according to the language in
the press release
.
The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.
Sponsor Message
Final recommendations were delayed
The step came after an
unusual, unexplained two-week lag
between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision
allows the CDC
to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.
""Informed consent is back,"" O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. ""CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.""
Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.
""There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients,"" said
Dorit Reiss
, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake.""
Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.
""The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines,"" wrote Dr.
Tina Tan
, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases.""
Sponsor Message
The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.
""If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use,"" Reiss added in an email. ""If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger.""
The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.
In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.
Barriers to vaccination
But the vaccines
became harder
to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.
The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.
Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more ""risk-based"" COVID vaccination strategy.
But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.
Sponsor Message
Over the past month, the change caused
anger, frustration and confusion
. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.
Treatments
The CDC still hasn't issued COVID vaccine guidelines, leaving access in limbo
The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.
Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC,
voted to recommend the shots
for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.
Confusion still reigns
The requirement for
shared clinical decision-making
creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.
The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)
But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.
Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.
Sponsor Message
In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.
Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.
A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended
O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.
Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to
CDC data shared
and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.
That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.
Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. ""This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option,"" says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, ""This is effectively removing a choice from parents.""
Sponsor Message
Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. ""There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined,"" she says, ""It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake.""
The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.
A fresh call to break up the MMR vaccine
A few hours after issuing the new vaccine guidelines, Acting CDC Director O'Neill also called on makers of the combined MMR vaccine to break it up into three separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella in
a post on X.com
. The post praised President Trump for his leadership and reposted his call in September that the MMR vaccine be administered as ""THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS.""
The combination shot for measles, mumps and rubella has been used in the U.S. for decades.
""This really is absolutely completely ridiculous and really sets us back over 50 years in time given that the MMR vaccine was licensed here in the US in 1971,"" said Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. ""It was made as a combination vaccine to ensure that persons would receive all the vaccines that they would need as a single shot as opposed to 3 separate injections. This is crazy and continues to erode the public health system and the public trust in vaccines.""
""There is no published scientific evidence that shows any benefit in separating the combination MMR vaccine into three individual shots,"" said a statement from Merck, which makes an
MMR vaccine
. ""Use of the individual components of combination vaccines increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.""
Sponsor Message
The statement also said that evidence suggests combination vaccines improve outcomes for kids by increasing completion of recommended vaccines and getting them at the right ages. Merck also said there are no single-shot vaccines approved for use in the U.S. for measles, mumps or rubella.
""Combination vaccines play a crucial role in improving vaccination coverage rates; their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated by decades of research,"" said a statement from GSK, maker of the other MMR vaccine available in the U.S. ""By reducing the number of separate injections required, combination vaccines allow for a simpler and more efficient immunization process, which is essential for timely protection against disease."""
health,"With hundreds of clinics specialized in hair transplants, Istanbul is a growing hub in the industry, attracting people from all over the world.

ISTANBUL — In a bright clinic on the eastern side of Istanbul, a man leans over another man's scalp.
There's a marker in his hand, and he's drawing thin, careful lines across the cranium. It looks almost like an art class. Except the canvas here is a human head.
Dr. Mehmet Erdogan (no relation to
Turkey's president
) runs the
Smile Hair Clinic
in Istanbul, a sleek multistory complex that boasts a 90-95% hair transplant success rate. Since it opened in 2018, the clinic has been treating around 5,000 patients every year. Most come from abroad: around a third come from the United States alone.
Sponsor Message
""OK, I will draw according to what I recommend to you,"" Erdogan says, as the pen squeaks against the scalp of his patient, Justin R., a registered nurse from California. Justin, in his early 40s, didn't want NPR to use his last name so that he could discuss a private health care issue.
Hair transplants aren't new — but suddenly, they're everywhere. And Turkey has become the industry's unofficial capital.
The country now draws patients from across the globe, lured by lower costs, bundled travel packages, and a growing network of clinics. The result has been a booming new industry, with significant economic gain. But although the procedure is generally
considered safe
when carried out by a skilled surgeon, the industry's success has prompted concerns about possible risks and oversight.
For Justin, the decision came down to dollars.
He told NPR his transplant, including airfare and lodging, cost him about $3,400. He was given quotes for more than double that at clinics he reached out to in California.
In the U.S., the average price for comparable procedures
runs upwards
of $13,000, according to a 2023 study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Turkey has built an entire industry on that kind of cost gap.
Sponsor Message
According to the Turkish Health Tourism Association, around 1 million people traveled
to the country
in 2022 for hair transplants alone, spending about $2 billion.
Nationwide, health tourism brought in even more: about 2 million medical tourists in 2024, generating close to $3 billion, according to
data from the Turkish Health Ministry
.
Walk through Istanbul's airports and you'll see the ads — smiling men with fresh hairlines, clinics promising all-inclusive packages with hotels, airport transfers, translators, even sightseeing.
The hidden risks
Not every story ends with a perfect hairline.
The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has
flagged concerns
about so-called ""black market clinics,"" where unlicensed practitioners perform delicate procedures or rush through multiple patients a day. The medical association says it has received reports of outcomes ranging from botched hairlines to infections and scarring.
Glen Jankowski, a psychologist at University College Dublin and author of forthcoming book
Branding Baldness
, warns there are also medical risks that go beyond the physical results.
""It's really important that, especially the hair follicles, you aren't doing too much harvesting in one session,"" he explains. ""It does have an effect on your blood pressure. It really is important that medically trained people are doing it — and sometimes that's not the case.""
Jankowski also says that patients are sometimes pushed onto medications like minoxidil or finasteride without full consent. ""Those drugs can have significant side effects,"" he says. ""You should only take them with proper medical advice and informed consent.""
The Turkish Health Ministry has pledged stricter oversight and more inspections. Still, critics say the sheer number of clinics — some estimates put it at 5,000 in Istanbul alone — makes enforcement difficult.
The social media effect
So why do so many men sign up? It's not just the savings. Or the vanity.
It's psychology — and TikTok.
""Most people worry about hair loss regardless of their actual hair count, because the advertising is so strong around it,"" says Jankowski.
Sponsor Message
At the Smile Hair Clinic, the waiting room tells this very story. A giant screen loops TikTok and Instagram reels from happy clients, swiping their hands over fresh hairlines. ""Five months ago I flew to Istanbul,"" one man boasts. ""Best decision ever.""
Social media has turned the transplant into a lifestyle upgrade. It's a makeover to flaunt, not hide. And the more men show off their results, the more normal the surgery feels.
A few months after his operation, NPR checked in with Justin R. He says he feels younger, more confident — and grateful he didn't have to spend twice as much back home.
Doctors like Erdogan say most patients feel the same. But he also admits the rush of clinics and customers has created a ""Wild West"" atmosphere, where it's up to patients to do their homework.
Of course, not everyone signs up.
Jankowski, the psychologist, has chosen another route.
""The hair we carry on top of our heads, we think it's really meaningful. It's not,"" he says. ""[My hair] doesn't clog my shower anymore. It doesn't fall into my porridge. There's a beauty and wisdom to [hair loss] we're unfortunately losing.""
For some, that's the safer and cheapest choice of all — shave it off and move on."
health,"Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.

Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.
The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. ""She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with,"" recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.
The message simply said: ""Pray for her.""
Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost ""lifeless."" Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.
Sponsor Message
""It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with,"" Firew says.
Soon it became clear.
This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.
On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the
country's first Marburg outbreak
— a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.
Goats and Soda
An 'unprecedented' good news story about a deadly viral outbreak
Now, a year later, the basics of
the outbreak
in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered
international renown
as a model for a successful outbreak response.
Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost
9 out of every 10 patients
. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.
Sponsor Message
Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.
""This is real""
After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. ""I was overcome with emotion — crying,"" says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.
A colleague saw her. ""He consoled me. He hugged me,"" Firew recalls.
She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's ""ouchie."" Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: ""I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit.""
Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.
""That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real,"" Firew says.
Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had
no approved treatment
and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?
""It was just extremely scary,"" she recalls.
Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?
""Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly,"" she says.
And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work
and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. ""He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere,"" Firew says.
Sponsor Message
She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.
All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. ""They would go isolate. They'd test positive,"" she says. ""And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died.""
""Mommy, I need you""
Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.
""Of course, I freak out,"" Firew says.
Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: "" 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' ""
For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.
The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.
She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.
""He was on the verge of dying,"" she recalls. ""The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices"" — their gums, their nose.
""Hearing voices""
The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, ""I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?""
Sponsor Message
Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?
After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. ""I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues,"" she says. ""Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up.""
The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.
""It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement,"" she says.
Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.

""No Marburg deniers""
But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.
Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.
It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.
Sponsor Message
""They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers,"" she recalls thinking.
Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?
""The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures,"" she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.
Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.
""Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity,"" Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her.
In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.
Sponsor Message
""The discussions about public health can be so discouraging,"" she says. ""But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile.""
She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.
Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. ""In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'"" says Firew.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.
Short Wave
You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.

Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan's Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Tuesday's physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

These and insights from thousands of other studies can all be traced to a trove of data the federal government started collecting more than 50 years ago. But earlier this year, that effort came to a halt.

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""
Sponsor Message
Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.
Sponsor Message
Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909
Nimrod expedition

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""

Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan's Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Tuesday's physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

These and insights from thousands of other studies can all be traced to a trove of data the federal government started collecting more than 50 years ago. But earlier this year, that effort came to a halt.

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""
Sponsor Message
Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.
Sponsor Message
Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909
Nimrod expedition

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""

Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan's Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Tuesday's physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

These and insights from thousands of other studies can all be traced to a trove of data the federal government started collecting more than 50 years ago. But earlier this year, that effort came to a halt.

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""
Sponsor Message
Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.
Sponsor Message
Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909
Nimrod expedition

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""

Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan's Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Tuesday's physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

These and insights from thousands of other studies can all be traced to a trove of data the federal government started collecting more than 50 years ago. But earlier this year, that effort came to a halt.

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""
Sponsor Message
Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.
Sponsor Message
Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909
Nimrod expedition

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""

Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.

Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.

""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan's Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Tuesday's physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

These and insights from thousands of other studies can all be traced to a trove of data the federal government started collecting more than 50 years ago. But earlier this year, that effort came to a halt.

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""
Sponsor Message
Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.
Sponsor Message
Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

New survey data finds that nearly 1 in 5 high schoolers say they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with artificial intelligence. And 42% of students surveyed say they or someone they know have used AI for companionship.
That's according to
new research
from the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights, civil liberties and responsible use of data and technology.
CDT conducted national surveys of roughly 800 sixth through 12th grade public school teachers, 1,000 ninth through 12th grade students and 1,000 parents. The vast majority — 86% of students, 85% of educators and 75% of parents — say they used AI during the last school year.
Sponsor Message
Life Kit
Why parents need to talk to their teens about AI — and how to start the conversation
CDT's Elizabeth Laird, one of the authors of the report, says the surveys showed some strong correlations.
Among them: ""The more ways that a student reports that their school uses AI, the more likely they are to report things like 'I know someone who considers AI to be a friend,' 'I know someone who considers AI to be a romantic partner.'""
Data breaches, deepfakes and damaged trust
Laird says the surveys found higher levels of AI use in schools — defined as seven to 10 school-related uses for teachers, and four to six for students — correlates with increased exposure to data breaches, troubling interactions between students and AI and AI-generated deepfakes, or manipulated videos or photos that can be used to sexually harass and bully students.
""This technology is a new vector for sexual harassment and bullying, which were long-standing issues [before widespread use of AI],"" Laird says, ""and this has become a new way to exacerbate that.""
According to the report, 28% of teachers who use AI for many school-related tasks say their school experienced a large-scale data breach, compared to 18% of teachers who don't use AI or use it for only a few tasks.
Laird, who previously worked as a data privacy officer for D.C.'s state education agency, says she believes the more data schools share with AI systems, the more they risk a data breach.
Education
Research, curriculum and grading: new data sheds light on how professors are using AI
""AI systems take a lot of data, they also spit out a lot of information too,"" she says. ""That is contributing to that connection.""
Teachers with higher levels of school-related AI use were also more likely to report that an AI system they were using in class failed to work as intended.
These teachers were also more likely to report that the use of AI damaged community trust in schools. For example, Laird says schools frequently use AI-powered software to monitor activity on school-issued devices, in some cases leading to false alarms and even
student arrests
. She says this is especially concerning for students who can't afford their own personal computers.
Sponsor Message
""So if you are someone who has a personal device and doesn't have to use a school-issued device, you can essentially afford to keep your documents and messages private,"" Laird says.
Risks to student wellbeing
Students who attend schools that use AI a lot were also more likely to report that they or a friend had used AI for mental health support, as a companion, as a way to escape reality and to have a romantic relationship.
When students reported having conversations with AI systems for personal reasons, and not for school work, 31% said they used a device or software provided by their school.
""I think students should know that they are not actually talking to a person. They are talking to a tool, and those tools have known limitations,"" Laird says. ""Our research suggests that the AI literacy and the training that students are getting are very basic.""
Business
'AI slop' videos may be annoying, but they're racking up views — and ad money
Laird says students and educators often aren't getting training or guidance to help them navigate the more complex challenges associated with the technology.
For example, only 11% of surveyed teachers said they received training on how to respond if they suspect a student's use of AI is detrimental to their wellbeing.
Educators who frequently use AI were more likely to say the technology improves their teaching, saves them time and provides individualized learning for students – but students in schools where AI use is prevalent reported higher levels of concern about the technology, including that it makes them feel less connected to their teachers.
""What we hear from students is that while there may be value in this, there's also some negative consequences that are coming with it, too,"" Laird says. ""And if we're going to realize the benefits of AI, you know, we really need to pay attention to what students are telling us."""

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal–organic frameworks that could eventually help reduce pollution and combat climate change. A member of the Nobel committee likened the discovery to Hermione Granger's seemingly bottomless enchanted handbag in the fictional ""Harry Potter"" series, in that the frameworks may look small from the outside, but are able to hold surprisingly vast quantities within them.
The Nobel Committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were being awarded for ""groundbreaking discoveries,"" saying ""some of these may contribute to solving some of humankind's greatest challenges.""

From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.
The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione's famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramström, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.
The chemists worked separately but added to each other's breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.

""Metal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,"" Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.
The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called ""forever chemicals"" from water.
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as ""forever chemicals.""

""This is a major thing that happens late in life when I'm not really in a condition to withstand it all,"" he said. ""But here we are.""
The 2024 prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.
The three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.
The first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.

What if one of the most famous and formidable Antarctic
exploration vessels
in history, whose crew's story of shipwreck and survival has been told for more than a century, wasn't as strong as legend had it?
A new
research paper
about the vessel Endurance casts doubt on some common beliefs about explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, particularly that it was one of the most well-built ships of its era and that it went down due to the loss of its rudder after becoming trapped in sea ice in 1915.
""Neither of that is true,"" said Jukka Tuhkuri, who wrote the paper and is a professor at Aalto University in Finland, where he studies sea ice and arctic marine technology. ""It was not a strong ship compared to other ships of its time, and it did not sink because of the rudder.""

Science
Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, lost since 1915, is found off Antarctica
Tuhkuri conducted ice science research aboard the
2022 expedition
that located the wreckage of Endurance. The trip got him curious about why the ship sank. He spent the intervening years conducting a technical analysis and combing through historical records, including drawings of the ship, photographs and personal letters.
His paper, published Monday in the
journal
Polar Record
, argues that Endurance had several structural shortcomings that made it ill-suited for the icy conditions of polar exploration and that Shackleton was aware of its weaknesses.
Shackleton alluded to the ship's deficiencies in a letter to his wife, where he wrote that Endurance was ""not as strong as [his earlier ship] Nimrod constructionally"" and that he would ""exchange her for the old Nimrod any day now except for comfort."" Shackleton and his crew got within 97 miles of the South Pole on the 1907-1909
Nimrod expedition

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance was originally named Polaris and was created for Arctic tourism before Shackleton bought it to use for polar exploration. The ship was built to withstand collisions with ice floes at the ice's edge, where polar bears could be found hunting.
""But Shackleton took it into pack ice that puts compressive loads on the hull,"" Tuhkuri said. ""And that's a different type of loading, and it requires different details in the hull, and those were not there.""
The Two-Way
Lost Images Come To Life A Century After Antarctic Expedition
In 1914, Shackleton led an expedition of 27 men on two ships — Endurance and Aurora — to Antarctica with the goal of traversing the continent on land. Shackleton and the crew of Endurance sailed to one end, while Aurora went to the other.
But before Endurance could reach the shore, it got snarled in dense sea ice in January 1915, leaving the ship and its crew stranded. The men lived on the frozen ship in the Weddell Sea for months but were ultimately forced to abandon it that October, taking lifeboats and a small amount of supplies. Endurance sank on Nov. 21, 1915. Shackleton and all members of the Endurance crew
eventually made it to safety and survived
. (All but three men from Aurora were rescued.)

Sea ice is not one flat piece of frozen water, according to Tuhkuri, but rather a ""mosaic"" of different-sized ice floes pushed around by wind and currents in ""constant, messy motion."" Endurance drifted in frozen ice for a while, but eventually the changing directions of the ice squeezed the ship and ultimately sank it, he said.
Tuhkuri said that Endurance had weaker pine deck beams and oak and pine frames than other comparable ships of the time. But certain design choices also made the ship's hull vulnerable, he said. The long machine room weakened it, and the hull lacked diagonal support beams found on other polar exploration vessels.

Tuhkuri also noted that while damage to the rudder sprung a leak in the ship, crew members were able to keep it under control; the more significant damage to Endurance was the ""tearing of the keel [the structural backbone running along the bottom of the ship], which broke the ship into two halves,"" he wrote.
Tuhkuri said he doesn't want to detract from the legacy of Shackleton's voyage but, rather, add a new detail to the historical record.
As he writes toward the end of his paper: ""Maybe Endurance was a strong and heroic ship in a poetic sense; in an engineering sense, unfortunately, it was not."""

Trump administration targets Education Department research arm in latest cuts
Researchers, educators and policymakers have relied on this data to form conclusions and shape policy about American education — everything from how high school counselors should be spending their days to when students should start taking higher-level math classes.
On a single day in February, the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) canceled the long-running series of surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies. The contracts were worth tens of millions of dollars.
The surveys started in 1972, and have gathered data on more than 100,000 high school students through their first decade or so of adulthood — sometimes longer.
""For 50 years, we've been mapping a timeline of progress of our high school system, and we're going to have a big blank,"" said Adam Gamoran, who was nominated to lead the Institute of Education Sciences, the U.S. Education Department's research and statistics arm, under President Biden, but was never confirmed. ""That's very frustrating.""
A Department of Education spokesperson said the agency is reviewing how longitudinal studies ""fit into the national data collection strategy based on studies' return on investment for taxpayers."" The statement also said the department's Institute of Education Sciences, which oversaw the longitudinal studies, remains committed to ""mission-critical functions.

How local school administrators use the federal surveys
Quintin Shepherd, the superintendent of Pflugerville ISD, just outside Austin, Texas, said these nationally representative surveys provide a point of comparison for how things are going in his own school district.
Education
How the Education Department cuts could hurt low-income and rural schools
""Where do we benchmark amongst others? And if we're leading, how can we continue to lead? If we're lagging, how can we find places where we can make improvements?"" Shepherd said.
To make those improvements, Shepherd said he again looks to the longitudinal data and the research it supports. Like research showing that career and technical education could increase the odds of getting a job after high school, or that taking algebra in middle school or early in high school sets students up better for college than if they take it in later years.
""I've seen entire systems, entire states, make evolutions towards knowing what's right and doing what's right as a result of this data,"" said Shepherd.
""We can't just pick this back up later""
Since the effort began in the early 1970s, the federal government has collected data on six large groups of high school students.
Researchers surveyed each group at least once during high school, along with some of the adults in their lives, like their parents and teachers, and then followed up with the students periodically after that, generally over the course of a decade or so. They collected transcripts and other documents to track progress, too. In total, the data set contains thousands of variables.
Such longitudinal data sets are valuable because they allow researchers to tease out effects that can't be seen in a single snapshot – but long-term efforts like this are also rare because they require sustained funding over decades.
The survey contracts that were canceled in February included a follow-up with high schoolers who graduated during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and a follow-up with students who were middle schoolers during the pandemic and who were surveyed as high school freshmen in 2022. Those younger students are scheduled to graduate this spring.

Elise Christopher oversaw the high school longitudinal studies at the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Institute of Education Sciences, until she was laid off in March along with dozens of her colleagues. Christopher, a statistician who worked at the center for more than 14 years, is concerned about the data that was scheduled to be collected this year and now won't be.

""We can't just pick this back up later,"" she said of the students graduating next year. ""They won't be in high school. We won't be able to understand what makes them want to come to school every day, because they'll be gone.""
Researchers were hoping to learn more about why chronic absenteeism has persisted in schools even years after COVID-19 abated, Christopher explained. They were also hoping to understand whether students are now less interested in attending college than previous generations.
""Every single person in this country who's been educated in the past 50 years has benefited from something that one of these longitudinal surveys has done,"" she said.
Stuart Buck is executive director of the Good Science Project, a group advocating for less bureaucracy in science funding.
""It seems to me that even if you were the most hardcore libertarian who wants the government to regulate almost nothing, collecting national statistics is about the most innocuous and useful thing that a government could do,"" he said.
He likened Trump's cuts to ""someone showing up to your house and claiming they saved you $200 a month, and it turns out they canceled your electricity.""
Never finding out how the story ends
Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and a former math educator, said the studies have been a reliable source of insights for math teachers across the country.
""Selfishly, for me as an educator in a pre-K-12 system, I want that information,"" she said. ""Because I want to make sure that we are doing the best that we can to provide students, in those formative years, with what they need.""

Knighten said she and educators like her looked to the studies to better understand what kind of math classes most benefit students after high school — in college or in the workforce. And insights from current high schoolers could be especially valuable in the coming years, she said, as technology rapidly changes jobs and opportunities for young workers.
Knighten said
the cancellation of the surveys is like ""reading a really good book and getting to the climax and just stopping and never finding out how the story ends.""

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

STOCKHOLM — Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.
Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.
The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus — a process called central tolerance.

You can thank these ancient microbes for your immune system
The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs.
Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.
The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs — which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.
The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.
""Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,"" said Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.
Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee, said he was only able to reach Sakaguchi by phone Monday morning.
""I got hold of him at his lab and he sounded incredibly grateful, expressed that it was a fantastic honor. He was quite taken by the news,"" Perlmann said. He added that he left voicemails for Brunkow and Ramsdell.

But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.
Sponsor Message
""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Department of Energy
is cancelling
more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Sponsor Message
The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment
, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure
Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains
, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies
Fossil Energy
, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration
froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding
for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought
announced the funding freeze
in a post on X.
Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
said
on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as
electricity demand is expected to rise significantly
for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to
limit the construction
of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium

This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""
Climate
Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""

A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions

November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.

With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes.

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.

In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Department of Energy
is cancelling
more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Sponsor Message
The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment
, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure
Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains
, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies
Fossil Energy
, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,
posted on X
.
A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration
froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding
for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought
announced the funding freeze
in a post on X.
Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
said
on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as
electricity demand is expected to rise significantly
for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to
limit the construction
of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Multiple fall foliage maps — including from

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

""Those are all crab shanties,"" he says over the boat's loudspeaker. ""That's where they shed the softshell crabs during the summer months.""
Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

Since 1850, the island has
lost two-thirds of its landmass
to erosion and sea level rise. On average, the island sits just three feet above sea level. Meanwhile, water levels in the Bay are rising by
at least a quarter of an inch each year
.

The island could be almost entirely underwater in the next 50 years, according to experts like
Dave Schulte, a climate change researcher and ecological restoration specialist who studied Tangier extensively. Schulte co-wrote
defining reports on the island in
2015
and
2021
and formerly worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.
In other words, it's
sinking.

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.
Baechtel moved to Tangier with his wife 12 years ago. A former D.C. police officer, he is now one of the island's only EMT's. He also served as the previous fire chief.
The island, which has two churches, is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs.
Baechtel points to a strip of sand in the distance.
""That's our beach. It's a mile-and-a-half long and no one's ever on it. The locals don't go there,"" Baechtel says. ""They're born on the water. They work on the water. They die on the water. They don't play here.""

caught global attention, leading to greater visibility for the small island, from both journalists and politicians.
President Trump even called Tangier Mayor
James Eskridge after seeing a story about the island

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

Schulte estimated that it would cost

""It's a lot of money for us, but to the government it's just pocket change,"" says Eskridge. ""You want to talk about saving Tangier, I'm not just talking about a small piece of land. I'm talking about a culture, a way of life.""
Like many on this island, Eskridge goes by a nickname: ""Ooker.""
""I used to have a pet rooster when I was maybe four years old or so. And people said I used to try to crow like the rooster did, and that's sort of how it came out. I'm not going to demonstrate it,"" Eskridge says.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

climate,"As a result of President Trump signing his key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July, the tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects will end if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027. Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Energy Department said in a

""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

electricity demand is expected to rise significantly

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.
A tiny ""Flonduran"" coral grows at The Florida Aquarium, crossbred from corals from Florida and Honduras. Researchers are now testing them on reefs off Miami to see how they handle warmer ocean temperatures.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The Department of Energy has told employees to avoid using certain words, including ""climate change,"" ""green"" and ""sustainable,"" according to an internal email sent to staff and obtained by NPR.
The details of the email were
first reported by Politico
. It was sent to employees of the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is the largest federal funder of clean energy technology. The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023
.

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.
Climate
Far more environmental data is being deleted in Trump's second term than before
The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to
restrict access to information
about climate change and undercut federal efforts to address its causes. The administration has canceled billions of dollars in
research funding
and shuttered
federal websites
that made public
critical data
about sea level rise, extreme weather and other effects of climate change.

the government about clean air and clean water regulations have also been let go,
as have scientists
who were synthesizing the latest research about how climate change affects the United States.

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has specifically tried to limit which words the Energy Department uses. Immediately after Trump took office in January, many instances of the term ""climate change"" were removed from the agency's website, according to one current and one former employee who helped carry out that directive. Both asked that their names not be made public because they fear political and legal retribution from the current administration.
The new directive goes further, expanding the list of banned phrases and excluding those terms from all work products."

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating
Hurricane Helene

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Multiple fall foliage maps — including from

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes.

"" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs

NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.

Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy

The Department of Energy has told employees to avoid using certain words, including ""climate change,"" ""green"" and ""sustainable,"" according to an internal email sent to staff and obtained by NPR.
The details of the email were
first reported by Politico
. It was sent to employees of the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is the largest federal funder of clean energy technology. The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023
.

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

Far more environmental data is being deleted in Trump's second term than before
The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to

research funding
and shuttered
federal websites
that made public
critical data
about sea level rise, extreme weather and other effects of climate change.

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has specifically tried to limit which words the Energy Department uses. Immediately after Trump took office in January, many instances of the term ""climate change"" were removed from the agency's website, according to one current and one former employee who helped carry out that directive. Both asked that their names not be made public because they fear political and legal retribution from the current administration.
The new directive goes further, expanding the list of banned phrases and excluding those terms from all work products."

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating
Hurricane Helene
, which was the second severe hurricane of the year and laid to waste entire towns as it ripped across the coast.

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Multiple fall foliage maps — including from

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""
Climate
Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

2021
and formerly worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

""It's a lot of money for us, but to the government it's just pocket change,"" says Eskridge. ""You want to talk about saving Tangier, I'm not just talking about a small piece of land. I'm talking about a culture, a way of life.""
Like many on this island, Eskridge goes by a nickname: ""Ooker.""

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Department of Energy
is cancelling
more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Sponsor Message
The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment
, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure
Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains
, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies
Fossil Energy
, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration
froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding
for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought
announced the funding freeze
in a post on X.
Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
said
on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as
electricity demand is expected to rise significantly
for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to
limit the construction
of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium

This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating

Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""
Climate
Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.
Baechtel moved to Tangier with his wife 12 years ago. A former D.C. police officer, he is now one of the island's only EMT's. He also served as the previous fire chief.
The island, which has two churches, is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when

""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which

if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.

video posted to the agency's YouTube account

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.

Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Department of Energy
is cancelling
more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment
, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure
Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains
, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies
Fossil Energy
, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,
posted on X
.
A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration
froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding
for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought
announced the funding freeze
in a post on X.
Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
said
on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as
electricity demand is expected to rise significantly
for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to
limit the construction
of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they
can be built quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Scientists are now trying to breed corals that can tolerate heat better, speeding up the natural process of evolution. Florida coral has been crossbred with coral from Honduras, creating what researchers call ""Flonduran"" corals.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a

Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

The island, which has two churches, is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs.
Baechtel points to a strip of sand in the distance.
""That's our beach. It's a mile-and-a-half long and no one's ever on it. The locals don't go there,"" Baechtel says. ""They're born on the water. They work on the water. They die on the water. They don't play here.""

Tangier Combined School had 38 students in the 2024-2025 school year, with just one graduating senior, Lukas Thomas.
Thomas told NPR that he plans to keep living on Tangier, which makes him a bit of an anomaly among young people here.
""There's a lot of people who disappear from the island after they graduate, and I understand that,"" says Thomas, whose job on a tugboat may keep him away from the island for weeks at a time.
""We don't have a lot of young kids here anymore,"" Baechtel says. ""Our median age is over 60. So it's problematic to get somebody to work on your house because everybody is in their 60s or older. That's an issue here on the island.""

Efforts to save Tangier from the water
Schulte's alarming predictions
caught global attention, leading to greater visibility for the small island, from both journalists and politicians.
President Trump even called Tangier Mayor
James Eskridge after seeing a story about the island
on CNN.
Trump told Eskridge then not to worry about rising sea levels, that the island would be there for hundreds more years. In 2024, Trump got
88% of the vote
on the island.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

Schulte estimated that it would cost
$250 to 350 million
to fully protect and restore the island. That would include applying protective stone along vulnerable shorelines, retrofitting plumbing and electrical throughout the town and raising the system of one-lane roads for transportation.
""It's a lot of money for us, but to the government it's just pocket change,"" says Eskridge. ""You want to talk about saving Tangier, I'm not just talking about a small piece of land. I'm talking about a culture, a way of life.""
Like many on this island, Eskridge goes by a nickname: ""Ooker.""
""I used to have a pet rooster when I was maybe four years old or so. And people said I used to try to crow like the rooster did, and that's sort of how it came out. I'm not going to demonstrate it,"" Eskridge says.

Eskridge works as both mayor of the small town and as a crabber. He considers himself an ambassador for the island.
""People say, why don't you just move somewhere else? But it's home,"" Eskridge says. ""We've been here for hundreds of years and we'd like to remain. And it's very doable.""
Doable, Eskridge says, but still too big to tackle on their own.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.

""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.

Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.

Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.
A tiny ""Flonduran"" coral grows at The Florida Aquarium, crossbred from corals from Florida and Honduras. Researchers are now testing them on reefs off Miami to see how they handle warmer ocean temperatures.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The Department of Energy has told employees to avoid using certain words, including ""climate change,"" ""green"" and ""sustainable,"" according to an internal email sent to staff and obtained by NPR.
The details of the email were
first reported by Politico
. It was sent to employees of the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is the largest federal funder of clean energy technology. The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023
.

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.
Climate
Far more environmental data is being deleted in Trump's second term than before
The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to
restrict access to information
about climate change and undercut federal efforts to address its causes. The administration has canceled billions of dollars in
research funding
and shuttered
federal websites
that made public
critical data
about sea level rise, extreme weather and other effects of climate change.

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has specifically tried to limit which words the Energy Department uses. Immediately after Trump took office in January, many instances of the term ""climate change"" were removed from the agency's website, according to one current and one former employee who helped carry out that directive. Both asked that their names not be made public because they fear political and legal retribution from the current administration.
The new directive goes further, expanding the list of banned phrases and excluding those terms from all work products."

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating
Hurricane Helene
, which was the second severe hurricane of the year and laid to waste entire towns as it ripped across the coast.

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

countries are submitting

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future."

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment

Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,

electricity demand is expected to rise significantly

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating
Hurricane Helene
, which was the second severe hurricane of the year and laid to waste entire towns as it ripped across the coast.

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Multiple fall foliage maps — including from

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""
Climate
Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

""Those are all crab shanties,"" he says over the boat's loudspeaker. ""That's where they shed the softshell crabs during the summer months.""
Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

at least a quarter of an inch each year

The island could be almost entirely underwater in the next 50 years, according to experts like
Dave Schulte, a climate change researcher and ecological restoration specialist who studied Tangier extensively. Schulte co-wrote

2015
and
2021
and formerly worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.
In other words, it's

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.
Baechtel moved to Tangier with his wife 12 years ago. A former D.C. police officer, he is now one of the island's only EMT's. He also served as the previous fire chief.
The island, which has two churches, is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs.

""That's our beach. It's a mile-and-a-half long and no one's ever on it. The locals don't go there,"" Baechtel says. ""They're born on the water. They work on the water. They die on the water. They don't play here.""

Thomas told NPR that he plans to keep living on Tangier, which makes him a bit of an anomaly among young people here.
""There's a lot of people who disappear from the island after they graduate, and I understand that,"" says Thomas, whose job on a tugboat may keep him away from the island for weeks at a time.
""We don't have a lot of young kids here anymore,"" Baechtel says. ""Our median age is over 60. So it's problematic to get somebody to work on your house because everybody is in their 60s or older. That's an issue here on the island.""

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

Schulte estimated that it would cost

""It's a lot of money for us, but to the government it's just pocket change,"" says Eskridge. ""You want to talk about saving Tangier, I'm not just talking about a small piece of land. I'm talking about a culture, a way of life.""
Like many on this island, Eskridge goes by a nickname: ""Ooker.""

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.

With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""
An estimated 54,000 tribal members across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, when tribes were often left out as energy infrastructure was built across the West, according to Wahleah Johns, a former director of the office.

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.
Sponsor Message
""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

The Department of Energy
is cancelling
more than $7 billion in funding for hundreds of projects that the agency said don't address the country's energy needs and aren't economically viable.
The DOE issued the announcement late Wednesday, the first day of a
government shutdown
and hours after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said the Trump administration was cancelling nearly $8 billion in ""Green New Scam funding."" Vought
posted on the social media site X
that the Energy Department funding was for projects in 16 states, all of which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Sponsor Message
The Energy Department said in a
news release
that it decided to terminate $7.56 billion for 223 projects after a ""thorough, individualized review.""
""President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations
, which works with the private sector to advance a range of energy technologies, including hydrogen, advanced nuclear and energy storage
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels
Grid Deployment
, which works on upgrading the country's electric infrastructure
Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains
, which invests in projects designed to improve the country's economic and national security
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
, which invests in cutting-edge energy technologies
Fossil Energy
, which funds projects to encourage domestic production of fossil fuels and critical minerals

Wright said the Energy Department has been reviewing funding that was ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard."" Funding recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, the department said.
Responding to Vought's announcement, Democratic lawmakers said that cancelling Energy Department funding is an effort by the Trump administration to punish Democrats during the government shutdown.
""Let's open our eyes. This isn't a functioning democracy any longer when — in the middle of a high stakes funding fight — the President illegally suspends federal projects in states run by Democrats as a way to punish the political opposition,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut,
posted on X

A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, referred NPR to the Energy Department for comment.
Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration
froze $18 billion in infrastructure funding
for New York City, home to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats. Vought
announced the funding freeze
in a post on X.
Vought ""has been dreaming about this moment, preparing [for] this moment since puberty,"" Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah,
said
on Fox News. ""Russ Vought has a plan, and that plan is going to succeed in empowering, further empowering Trump. This is going to be the Democrats' worst nightmare,"" Lee said.
The move to cancel Energy Department funding comes as
electricity demand is expected to rise significantly
for the first time in decades. In the face of rising power demand, the Trump administration has been taking steps to
limit the construction
of renewable energy projects. Utility executives and analysts have said clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because they

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.

Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

Since 1850, the island has

at least a quarter of an inch each year

The island could be almost entirely underwater in the next 50 years, according to experts like
Dave Schulte, a climate change researcher and ecological restoration specialist who studied Tangier extensively. Schulte co-wrote

2021
and formerly worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.
Baechtel moved to Tangier with his wife 12 years ago. A former D.C. police officer, he is now one of the island's only EMT's. He also served as the previous fire chief.
The island, which has two churches, is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""
Any help the island has gotten has been slow, Schulte said.
A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990.
And a stone jetty
, or breakwater, to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte said both projects took decades to complete.
""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

Today's [cancellations] deliver on that commitment,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. ""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Scientists are now trying to breed corals that can tolerate heat better, speeding up the natural process of evolution. Florida coral has been crossbred with coral from Honduras, creating what researchers call ""Flonduran"" corals. For the first time in the U.S., those coral babies have been put into the wild in a controlled trial.

Researchers are hopeful that Florida will develop a strategy that can be copied around the world to help ailing reefs. The question is whether it can be scaled up enough to make a meaningful difference — or whether temperatures will simply get too hot for corals.
""Florida occupies an unenviable position right now of having the world's coral reef eyes on it, because of the state of the resource and the fact that we are so dependent on it,"" says Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. ""So if anywhere in the world is going to try to do something a little out of the box, it's Florida.""
When corals collected from Honduras spawned, releasing their genetic material, scientists crossbred them with coral from Florida. Spawning only happens once or twice per year.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Those coral restoration groups largely focused on elkhorn and staghorn corals, which grow quickly and provide key habitat for fish and marine life.
Those branching corals are also the most sensitive to heat.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

Crossbreeding corals
At the University of Miami, the tiny ""Flonduran"" elkhorn corals are about the size of a quarter, the result of years of planning and international logistics. Their Honduran parents came from a reef known to experience tough conditions for elkhorn coral — high temperatures and murky water.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.
Climate

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.

Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""

.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes.

"" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent.

One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.

""Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.""
The Energy Department has not released a list of projects that are subject to the cancellations. The department did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The funding awards were issued by six offices at the Energy Department:
Clean Energy Demonstrations

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
, which promotes technologies that can lower energy costs and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels

In a lab at the University of Miami, there are tanks of knobby, tan-colored corals from Florida, Honduras and the Cayman Islands. They've been drafted into a sort of coral Olympics, as scientists look for the ones that can best survive increasingly hotter ocean temperatures driven by climate change.
Over the past two years,
80% of the world's reefs
saw dangerous levels of heat, which causes coral to bleach, turning a ghostly white color.
Florida's reefs are on the front line of the crisis. Corals there bleached again this summer, and already more than
90% of the living coral
off the Florida Keys has died. So for decades, the focus has been on restoring reefs by growing and planting coral in the ocean, much like replanting a forest.
The past three summers have been the worst on record for Florida's coral reefs, where weeks of heat stress have caused corals to bleach, turning them white. Coral can recover from bleaching, but prolonged heat will cause some to die.

Florida's ghost reefs
Ken Nedimyer is one of the few people who know what Florida's reefs used to look like. He's been diving off the Florida Keys for more than 50 years and says the fields of coral used to be so dense, you couldn't swim through them. They were filled with delicate, branching corals known as elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, which resemble antlers.
Climate
Scientists are breeding 'super corals.' Can they withstand climate change?
""Just incredible,"" says Nedimyer, technical director of Reef Renewal USA, a coral restoration group. ""You could look left and right and forward and you couldn't see anything but that. These great big branches would go out 6 feet from the base, all interlaced into each other.""
Now, those reefs are just a memory.
""The elkhorn coral, except for maybe one or two reefs off Key Largo, it's all dead,"" Nedimyer says. ""All completely dead.""
Florida's coral reefs have declined for decades because of many threats, including poor water quality and damage from boating and human impacts. The waterborne Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease spread as well, which kills some species of coral.
Elkhorn coral, known for their wide branching arms, are sensitive to heat. Temperatures got so hot in 2023 that some corals didn't have time to bleach and died outright.

In 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the
Mission Iconic Reefs
program, setting a goal to restore coral cover from just 2% to 25% on seven reefs off the Florida Keys. NOAA works with nonprofits like Nedimyer's, which grow coral in nurseries and plant it on the reefs. In the first five years, about 40,000 corals were planted. To reach its goal, NOAA estimates it will need 5 million corals.

Marine heat wave hits
In 2023, the ocean around Florida started
heating up far earlier than normal
. Water temperatures reached well into the 90s, hotter than branching corals can withstand. Heat disrupts a key partnership that corals depend on. They rely on algae that live inside their tissue, which use sunlight to make food for the coral. But when corals get heat-stressed, those algae get ejected, which is why corals turn white.
Bleaching doesn't necessarily kill coral, but after weeks of heat stress, corals can starve and become susceptible to other stressors. On some reefs that had been restored, NOAA found that
95% of the elkhorn coral had died
.
""It looked like there was a snowstorm, just white coral everywhere,"" Nedimyer says. ""Two weeks later and you go out there and they're all gray and dead. And it was so hard to see. Twenty years of hard work gone in one week.""
As the temperature rose in 2023, a team from the University of Miami removed coral they had growing in the ocean in the hope of rescuing it. Many coral restoration groups raise coral in offshore nurseries before it's planted on reefs, but much of it was lost in the 2023 heat wave.

The extreme temperatures were also a glimpse of the future. Marine heat waves are becoming more common, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world to climate change. Studies show that if climate change stays on the current path, surpassing 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100,
99% of the world's coral will be lost
.
It was a moment of reckoning for Florida's coral restoration community.
Climate
Coral reefs can't keep up with climate change. So scientists are speeding up evolution
""Just knowing what it's going to look like really helped us to focus on how we're going to prepare for it,"" Nedimyer says. ""What we were doing was not going to work.""
Nedimyer's team is now focusing more on the coral species that survived the 2023 heat wave better. The large, round corals, known as brain and boulder corals, are slower growing but fare better in higher temperatures. He's developing plans for an onshore coral nursery, so larger amounts of corals can be grown in tanks, before being put into the ocean. Still, in a hotter future, he knows Florida's reef may need even tougher corals.

""The reef in Tela, Honduras, routinely experiences temperatures that are about 1 1/2 to 2 degrees warmer than Florida's warmest temperatures and those are about the same kind of conditions that we saw in Florida in the 2023 bleaching event,"" says Baker of the University of Miami.
The hope is that the Honduran coral can pass on their ability to withstand heat in their genetics. It's blended with the genetics of Florida's coral, since they have their own strengths suited to the local environment. The technique is known as ""
assisted gene flow
,"" a way of speeding up the process of adaptation within a species.
Corals like this brain coral were collected in Honduras from a reef that routinely experiences warmer temperatures than Florida. Researchers hope the corals will pass on that ability to their young.

Baker worked with a nonprofit in Honduras, Tela Marine, and The Florida Aquarium
to bring the coral to the U.S.
This summer, their young were planted on a reef off Miami to test how they grow on Florida's reefs.
""So far so good, they're all doing great,"" Baker says. ""But we're under heat stress, so we are actually very interested to see what happens in this pretty severe bleaching event.""
It's the first time that state regulators have permitted an internationally bred coral in U.S. waters. Regulators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered the risks of the introduction, given the damage worldwide that invasive species have caused through accidental introductions. Researchers have also crossbred Florida corals with ones from Curaçao, but regulators did not permit them to be planted in the ocean. While the parent corals are the same species, they determined the populations were too genetically different to be released in the wild.
This summer, the ""Flonduran"" corals were planted on reefs off Miami. Researchers are eager to see how they fared during the hottest months when other corals were bleaching.

""Rightly, we've been very protective of environments to try to prevent introductions when we can,"" Baker says. ""I think what's changed on Florida's coral reef is that the conditions are no longer suited for the coral we have here. So we really have to think about bringing in new diversity.""
Sponsor Message
Still, Baker says the work isn't about creating a ""super coral."" Corals that are all-stars at dealing with heat may struggle to deal with other threats, like disease. Reefs need a mix of genetic diversity to withstand what nature throws their way.
""What we want is lots of different super corals that were generated in different ways so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket,"" Baker says.
Baker's lab is also looking at breeding corals from the Cayman Islands. He's hopeful that countries around the Caribbean will benefit from their research, an incentive for sharing coral samples. But he says the
lengthy international permitting process
makes moving coral samples challenging. Countries like the Bahamas
have also passed laws
limiting the export of their biological materials, after a
historical legacy
of richer countries extracting and patenting discoveries made in developing nations.
Still, Baker says he's hopeful that coral conservation work can be reciprocal for all the countries involved, given the dire situation that all reefs face.
""It's not all just about Florida,"" Baker says. ""I think we have a role to play here in Miami where we have the resources to help other countries generate varieties of corals that will do well in their countries."""

The Department of Energy has told employees to avoid using certain words, including ""climate change,"" ""green"" and ""sustainable,"" according to an internal email sent to staff and obtained by NPR.
The details of the email were
first reported by Politico
. It was sent to employees of the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is the largest federal funder of clean energy technology. The office supports research about how to build homes and cars more efficiently, and it helps fund research about renewable energy, including solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technology and geothermal energy. It had a budget of
$3.46 billion in fiscal year 2023
.

The Energy Department denies that its employees were told to avoid using specific terms. ""There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as 'climate change' or 'emissions.' President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science,"" Department of Energy press secretary Ben Dietderich wrote in response to questions from NPR.
The email obtained by NPR instructs employees working on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to avoid using about a dozen words and phrases, many of which are central to their work.
The banned phrases include:
""climate change,"" which is primarily caused by humans burning oil, gas and coal
""decarbonization,"" a common term in energy policy and research that refers to reductions in carbon dioxide pollution
""clean energy,"" which is often used to refer to solar, wind and other sources of electricity that do not rely on fossil fuels
""energy transition,"" which generally refers to the economy-wide shift away from oil, gas and coal that is already taking place as governments and corporations try to reduce planet-warming pollution
The email warns employees to avoid using the words in all parts of their work. The prohibition extends to the Energy Department website, internal reports and public documents, including those that describe federal funding opportunities.

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has specifically tried to limit which words the Energy Department uses. Immediately after Trump took office in January, many instances of the term ""climate change"" were removed from the agency's website, according to one current and one former employee who helped carry out that directive. Both asked that their names not be made public because they fear political and legal retribution from the current administration.
The new directive goes further, expanding the list of banned phrases and excluding those terms from all work products."

Parts of the southeastern United States are bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda, just one year after
Hurricane Helene
tore through the region, leaving casualties and calamity in its wake.
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster put residents under a state of emergency in preparation for the storm, which is expected to impact parts of the East Coast starting early this week.
""While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the ENTIRE state of South Carolina,"" McMaster said in a
statement
Friday.

""We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations,"" he said.
Forecasters upgraded the strengthening tropical depression to Tropical Storm Imelda on Sunday afternoon.
The system is currently tracking across parts of the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and is expected to affect eastern Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend as it intensifies.
Parts of the central and northwestern Bahamas were already
experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall
Sunday morning, with a storm surge as high as three feet expected to rise later in the day and into the evening, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.
Impacts on the U.S.
Imelda is set to intensify before it reaches the U.S., forecasters warned. The NHC said Imelda is set to become a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
The
NHC said
areas of central Florida along the East Coast could experience tropical storm conditions beginning on Monday. A large swath of Florida's eastern coastline was under a tropical storm watch on Sunday afternoon.
Further up the coast, Georgia and the Carolinas were also preparing for harsh conditions. ""Heavy rainfall across the coastal Carolinas could cause flash, urban, and river flooding into Wednesday morning,"" the
agency said
Sunday. Cities including
Savannah, Ga.
, and
Charleston, S.C.
, were distributing sandbags to residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding.

The risk of strong wind impacts through the southeastern U.S. was dropping, the NHC said, but the storm could cause ""dangerous marine conditions and rip currents"" along much of the East Coast early this week.
The southeastern U.S. has thus far been spared the brunt of the year's Atlantic hurricane season.
The region had been repeatedly battered by years of intense storm seasons, including last year's devastating
Hurricane Helene
, which was the second severe hurricane of the year and laid to waste entire towns as it ripped across the coast.

It's officially fall in the Northern Hemisphere, which means bright, beautiful foliage isn't far behind.
Parts of the U.S. will soon start to see — if they haven't already — leaves and shrubs trade their green hues for vibrant shades of orange, yellow and red as the days get shorter and temperatures get chillier.
""It's a really cool process that we get to watch, that trees are preparing for winter,"" says Alexandra Kosiba, extension assistant professor of forestry at the University of Vermont.

Simon Says
Opinion: Nature dazzles in autumn
Trees shed their leaves in order to store and recycle valuable nutrients (in their trunks and branches) before winter's ice and snow can rip them off. As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.
Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.
This year,
Almanac
predicts
that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Multiple fall foliage maps — including from

But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.
""No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,"" Kosiba says. ""We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.""

Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.
""If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,"" she says.

Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.
A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.
""In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,"" Kosiba says. ""But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.""
Climate
Weird weather isn't always because of climate change — but sometimes it is
Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage
by about a week
since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that ""
leaf-peeping"" entered the modern lexicon
.
These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the
National Park Service
, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.
Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to
Almanac
, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.

New England is currently
experiencing drought conditions
— despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.
But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.
Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.
""So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,"" she says. ""And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.""
Climate
The first day of fall marks the autumn equinox, which is different from a solstice
If you're worried about missing peak Northeast foliage, or planning a last-minute leaf-peeping trip, Kosiba's advice is ""just keep driving south."" Southern New England and parts of the Mid-Atlantic may not see their colors peak until late October or even November.
""My thought personally, because I love the fall foliage season, is that it's always good somewhere,"" she says. ""So if it seems a little brown where you are, go a little bit to a different location.""
Even if you're staying local, there are a few tricks you can try to get a more colorful view. Kosiba recommends going to a higher elevation, especially if you're in a dry place. Wetlands can be a great place to look for fall foliage, especially for deep reds. And don't forget to look down.
""We often think of fall foliage on trees, but a lot of our shrubs in our forests, even our ferns, turn really nice colors,"" she says, mentioning blueberry shrubs, viburnums and understory plants, a category that includes ferns and mosses. ""There's usually something good to see somewhere."""

Tangier Island — off the mainland coast of Virginia — is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. Before colonial settlers arrived in the 1700s, Indigenous people likely traveled to the island in the summer to take advantage of the abundant fish and crabs,
according to the National Park Service
. Many descendants of the original settlers — with surnames like Crockett, Parks and Thomas — have remained to this day. The isolation has allowed the development of a unique accent, one that some residents describe as a mix between ""Southern"" and ""Elizabethan"" English.

2021
and formerly worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
""Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25-30 years,"" Schulte told NPR.
Climate change is worsening the erosion of the island, contributing to both higher sea levels and more damaging storms.
""Erosion has always been an issue for all Chesapeake Bay islands, but sea level rise is accelerating the rate at which it's occurring. Then, you've got storms, which have always been an issue,"" Schulte said. ""But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.""
On top of all this, the entire Chesapeake Bay region is ""subsiding tectonically,"" according to Schulte.
In other words, it's

Rob Baechtel met NPR at the Tangier Island dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle. Because the island is so small, most residents get around on golfcarts, UTV's, bikes and mopeds, rather than cars.

Still, though Tangier is less than 100 miles from Washington, D.C., Schulte said: ""They haven't gotten any real help. You know, and it just amazes me that even after all this attention and the dire situation that they're in, they're just not getting the help that they need.""

""They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island,"" Schulte said. ""It doesn't have that much time.""
In a statement, the White House said the Department of the Interior takes a ""proactive approach to support Tangier"" through the U.S. Geological Survey's monitoring of rising sea levels to inform management of the coast, and conservation efforts by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to sustain crabbing.

The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.
A
new report
, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).
The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as
countries are submitting
their
nationally determined contributions
, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in
November in Belém, Brazil
. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.
""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.
China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the
dirtiest in terms of climate pollution
.
""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries
reviewed their progress
at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account
Trump administration policies
that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.
While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those
changes won't happen quickly
. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.
Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing
climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants
, reversing a
2009 finding that climate pollution harms people
and eliminating
climate pollution limits on vehicles
.
The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.
""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he
announced rollbacks
.
Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

climate,"As a result of President Trump signing his key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July, the tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects will end if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027. Now, without those tax credits, Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma (pictured here) and his tribe will have to go back to the drawing board to finance large-scale utility renewable energy projects that could power the entire reservation and provide an economic boost to the tribe.

For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.
But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including
some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States
.
Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.
""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.
The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.
The Hopi Reservation spans more than 1.5 million acres, with 12 villages distinctly located across three mesas in northeast Arizona. Some homes are located in the valleys, surrounded by four-wing saltbush, a shrub that can grow up to 3 feet, and juniper trees, which grow across the high desert plains.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing
nearly $2 billion to tribes
to invest in renewable energy.
The Hopi were approved for a
$25 million grant
to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
But in August, the Trump administration terminated the
Solar for All program, calling it wasteful
.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.
""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope  and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""
""The whole objective with renewables is to try to steer away from some of what's creating climate change,"" Nuvangyaoma says. The late-afternoon sun shines over the village of Shongopovi.

A game changer for tribes
The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated
54,000 tribal members
across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.
""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.
On Aug. 7, the Environmental Protection Agency sent termination letters to all Solar for All grant awardees, including the Hopi Tribe, which had been approved for $25 million from the program. That money would have connected around 600 homes to solar power and battery-powered electricity. Here, a village on the Hopi Reservation is seen atop a mesa.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when
tribes were often left out
as energy infrastructure was built across the West.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.
The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.
Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.
Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""
According to the U.S. Census Bureau
, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.
But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which
ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects
if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is  the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.
""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.
With Solar for All terminated, the Hopi will be able to provide electricity for only around 100 homes. Hopi Tribe Vice Chairman Craig Andrews says they're having to pick and choose who is more deserving of electricity. Older adults? People with disabilities? "" We shouldn't be doing that,"" Andrews says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a
video posted to the agency's YouTube account
.
""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices  tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.
""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""
The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""
The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.
For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and
about 85% of the Hopi's revenue
vanished.

unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%
, nearly three times higher than the national average.
NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.
One major solar project that is already operating on the Hopi lands is the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, which treats water contaminated with high levels of arsenic, which has plagued the tribe since the 1960s. The project was funded by the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the tribe to address the unsafe drinking water. Solar energy and a battery grid power the pump, which pushes water through pipes.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.
In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.
Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.
The sun sets over a quiet highway leading to the three mesas of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. ""Now that this bill has passed, it is taking away that ability for tribes to continue to explore wind, solar and battery storage. And I think that is stepping on tribal self-determination,"" says Wahleah Johns, a former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.
""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""
Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.
Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.
"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.
Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""
The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.
"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""
Nearly 900 homes, with close to 3,000 tribal members, do not have power on the Hopi Reservation. Those tribal members have had to rely on generators to keep refrigerated food cold and water and medical devices running. For tribal members with access to electricity, they find that it's incredibly unstable, because if there's an issue anywhere along the 30-mile power line that runs through the reservation, everybody loses power and those outages can sometimes last days.
